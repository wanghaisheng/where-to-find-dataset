## abstracts:
Sgr A* is currently very faint. However, X-ray radiation reflected by the Sgr A complex, a group of nearby molecular clouds, suggests that it went through one or more periods of high activity some hundreds of years ago. We aim to determine whether previously proposed physical scenarios are consistent with the observed X-ray variability over the past 25 years, and to characterize the spatial distribution, shape, and internal structure of the clouds. We exploit the full set of XMM-Newton observations, extending the previously studied dataset on variability by at least 12 years. Starting from the recent IXPE result that places the so-called Bridge cloud 26 pc behind Sgr A*, we reconstruct the LOS position of the other clouds, assuming that they were illuminated by a single flare. Additionally, we derive the probability density function (PDF) of the molecular density. We also study the 3D geometry of the complex in case two flares illuminate the clouds. As of spring 2024, the lightfront is still illuminating the Sgr A complex, with the Bridge currently being the brightest cloud. The other clouds in the complex have faded significantly. In the single flare scenario, the Sgr A complex is located $\simeq$ 25 pc behind Sgr A*. In the past 25 years, the illuminated region spans 10-15 pc along the LOS. The derived PDF is roughly log-normal, consistent with previous Chandra results, with a possible high-density excess. Both a single and a multiple flares scenario can explain the observed X-ray variability. Previous concerns about the single flare scenario, raised by shorter monitoring, are now overcome in the 25 years of monitoring. If two flares illuminate the clouds, they must be separated by at least $\sim$ 30 years. We speculate that these clouds are closer to Sgr A* than the nuclear molecular ring at $\simeq$ 100-200 pc and possibly drifting from the ring to the inner region of the Galaxy.
