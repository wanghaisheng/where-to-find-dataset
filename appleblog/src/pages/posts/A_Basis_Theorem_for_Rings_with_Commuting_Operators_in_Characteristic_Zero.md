## abstracts:
Motivated by the differential basis theorem of Kolchin and the difference-differential basis theorem of Cohn, in this paper we present a basis theorem for polynomial rings equipped with commuting generalised Hasse-Schmidt operators (in the sense of Moosa and Scanlon). We recover Kolchin and Cohn's results as special cases of our main theorem.
