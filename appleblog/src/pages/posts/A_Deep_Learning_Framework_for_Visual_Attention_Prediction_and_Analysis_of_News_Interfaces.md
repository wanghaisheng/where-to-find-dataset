## abstracts:
News outlets' competition for attention in news interfaces has highlighted the need for demographically-aware saliency prediction models. Despite recent advancements in saliency detection applied to user interfaces (UI), existing datasets are limited in size and demographic representation. We present a deep learning framework that enhances the SaRa (Saliency Ranking) model with DeepGaze IIE, improving Salient Object Ranking (SOR) performance by 10.7%. Our framework optimizes three key components: saliency map generation, grid segment scoring, and map normalization. Through a two-fold experiment using eye-tracking (30 participants) and mouse-tracking (375 participants aged 13--70), we analyze attention patterns across demographic groups. Statistical analysis reveals significant age-based variations (p < 0.05, {\epsilon^2} = 0.042), with older users (36--70) engaging more with textual content and younger users (13--35) interacting more with images. Mouse-tracking data closely approximates eye-tracking behavior (sAUC = 0.86) and identifies UI elements that immediately stand out, validating its use in large-scale studies. We conclude that saliency studies should prioritize gathering data from a larger, demographically representative sample and report exact demographic distributions.
