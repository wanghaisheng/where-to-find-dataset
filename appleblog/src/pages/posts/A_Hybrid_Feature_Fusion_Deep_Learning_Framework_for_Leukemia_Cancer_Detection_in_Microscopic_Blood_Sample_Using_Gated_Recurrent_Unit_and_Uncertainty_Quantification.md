## abstracts:
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most malignant form of leukemia and the most common cancer in adults and children. Traditionally, leukemia is diagnosed by analyzing blood and bone marrow smears under a microscope, with additional cytochemical tests for confirmation. However, these methods are expensive, time consuming, and highly dependent on expert knowledge. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has provided advanced methods for classifying microscopic smear images, aiding in the detection of leukemic cells. These approaches are quick, cost effective, and not subject to human bias. However, most methods lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, which could lead to critical misdiagnoses. In this research, hybrid deep learning models (InceptionV3-GRU, EfficientNetB3-GRU, MobileNetV2-GRU) were implemented to classify ALL. Bayesian optimization was used to fine tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance. Additionally, Deep Ensemble uncertainty quantification was applied to address uncertainty during leukemia image classification. The proposed models were trained on the publicly available datasets ALL-IDB1 and ALL-IDB2. Their results were then aggregated at the score level using the sum rule. The parallel architecture used in these models offers a high level of confidence in differentiating between ALL and non-ALL cases. The proposed method achieved a remarkable detection accuracy rate of 100% on the ALL-IDB1 dataset, 98.07% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset, and 98.64% on the combined dataset, demonstrating its potential for accurate and reliable leukemia diagnosis.
