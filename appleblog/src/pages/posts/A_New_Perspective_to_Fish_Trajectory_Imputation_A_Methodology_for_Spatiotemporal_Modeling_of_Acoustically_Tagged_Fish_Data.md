## abstracts:
The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.
