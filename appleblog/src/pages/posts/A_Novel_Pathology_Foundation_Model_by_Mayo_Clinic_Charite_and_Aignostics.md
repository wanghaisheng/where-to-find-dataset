## abstracts:
Recent advances in digital pathology have demonstrated the effectiveness of foundation models across diverse applications. In this report, we present a novel vision foundation model based on the RudolfV approach. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1.2 million histopathology whole slide images, collected from two medical institutions: Mayo Clinic and Charit\'e - Universt\"atsmedizin Berlin. Comprehensive evaluations show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across twenty-one public benchmark datasets, even though it is neither the largest model by parameter count nor by training dataset size.
## QA:
coming soon
