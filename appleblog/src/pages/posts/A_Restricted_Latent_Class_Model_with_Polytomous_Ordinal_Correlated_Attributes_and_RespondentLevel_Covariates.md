## abstracts:
We present an exploratory restricted latent class model where response data is for a single time point, polytomous, and differing across items, and where latent classes reflect a multi-attribute state where each attribute is ordinal. Our model extends previous work to allow for correlation of the attributes through a multivariate probit and to allow for respondent-specific covariates. We demonstrate that the model recovers parameters well in a variety of realistic scenarios, and apply the model to the analysis of a particular dataset designed to diagnose depression. The application demonstrates the utility of the model in identifying the latent structure of depression beyond single-factor approaches which have been used in the past.
