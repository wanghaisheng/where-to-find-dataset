## abstracts:
The detection and intervention of mental health issues represent a critical global research focus, and social media data has been recognized as an important resource for mental health research. However, how to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health problem detection on social media poses significant challenges. Hence, this paper aims to explore the potential of LLM applications in social media data analysis, focusing not only on the most common psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety but also incorporating psychotic disorders and externalizing disorders, summarizing the application methods of LLM from different dimensions, such as text data analysis and detection of mental disorders, and revealing the major challenges and shortcomings of current research. In addition, the paper provides an overview of popular datasets, and evaluation metrics. The survey in this paper provides a comprehensive frame of reference for researchers in the field of mental health, while demonstrating the great potential of LLMs in mental health detection to facilitate the further application of LLMs in future mental health interventions.
