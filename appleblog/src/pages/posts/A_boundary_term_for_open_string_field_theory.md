## abstracts:
We consider Witten's open string field theory in the presence of a non-trivial boundary of spacetime. For the kinetic term, we derive a Gibbons-Hawking-type contribution that has to be added to the action to guarantee a well-defined variational principle. The derivation is done first in a heuristic way and then confirmed by a path integral based approach using the CFT operator formalism. In the last section we use the latter method to compute the boundary contributions coming from the cubic vertex, although it is problematic to apply consistent boundary conditions on the string field due to the non-locality of the vertex.
## QA:
coming soon
