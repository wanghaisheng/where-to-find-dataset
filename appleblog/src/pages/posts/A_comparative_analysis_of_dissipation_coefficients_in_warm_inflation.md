## abstracts:
In the warm inflation scenario, the early cosmic acceleration is driven by the inflaton coupled to thermal fields, decaying into radiation and leaving a hot universe populated by relativistic particles after the end of inflation. The interaction is usually modeled by a dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon$ that contains the microphysics of the model. In this work, we adopt a well-motivated potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ and constrain a variety of $\Upsilon$ parameterizations by using updated Cosmic Microwave Background data from the \textit{Planck} and \textit{BICEP/Keck Array} collaborations. We also use a Bayesian statistical criterion to compare the observational viability of these models. Our results show a significant improvement in the constraints over past results reported in the literature and also that some of these warm inflation models can be competitive compared to Starobinsky inflation.
