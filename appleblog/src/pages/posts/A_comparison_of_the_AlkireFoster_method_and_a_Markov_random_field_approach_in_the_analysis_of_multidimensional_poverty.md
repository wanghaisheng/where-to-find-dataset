## abstracts:
Multidimensional poverty measurement is crucial for capturing deprivation beyond income-based metrics. This study compares the Alkire-Foster (AF) method and a Markov Random Field (MRF) approach for classifying multidimensional poverty using a simulation-based analysis. The AF method applies a deterministic threshold-based classification, while the MRF approach leverages probabilistic graphical modelling to account for correlations between deprivation indicators. Using a synthetic dataset of 50,000 individuals with ten binary deprivation indicators, we assess classification accuracy, false positive/negative trade-offs, and agreement between the methods. Results show that AF achieves higher classification accuracy (89.5%) compared to MRF (75.4%), with AF minimizing false negatives and MRF reducing false positives. The overall agreement between the two methods is 65%, with discrepancies primarily occurring when AF classifies individuals as poor while MRF does not. While AF is transparent and easy to implement, it does not capture interdependencies among indicators, potentially leading to misclassification. MRF, though computationally intensive, offers a more nuanced understanding of deprivation clusters. These findings highlight the trade-offs in multidimensional poverty measurement and provide insights for policymakers on method selection based on data availability and policy objectives. Future research should extend these approaches to non-binary indicators and real-world datasets.
