## abstracts:
We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.
## QA:
coming soon
