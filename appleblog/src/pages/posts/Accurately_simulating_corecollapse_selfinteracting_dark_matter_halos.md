## abstracts:
The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.
