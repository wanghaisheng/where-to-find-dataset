## abstracts:
This study introduces an outlier-robust model for analyzing hierarchically structured bounded count data within a Bayesian framework, utilizing a logistic regression approach implemented in JAGS. Our model incorporates a t-distributed latent variable to address overdispersion and outliers, improving robustness compared to conventional models such as the beta-binomial, binomial-logit-normal, and standard binomial models. Notably, our approach models the median of the response variable, presenting a more convenient and interpretable measure of central tendency, which is available in closed form. For comparability between all models, we also make predictions based on the mean proportion; however, this involves an integration step for the t-distributed nuisance parameter. While limited literature specifically addresses outliers in mixed models for bounded count data, this research fills that gap. The practical utility of the model is demonstrated using a longitudinal medication adherence dataset, where patient behavior often results in abrupt changes and outliers within individual trajectories. A simulation study demonstrates the binomial-logit-t model's strong performance, with comparison statistics favoring it among the four evaluated models. An additional data contamination simulation confirms its robustness against outliers. Our robust approach maintains the integrity of the dataset, effectively handling outliers to provide more accurate and reliable parameter estimates.
