## abstracts:
This project focuses on creating a smart surveillance system for Indian cities that can identify and analyze people's attributes in real time. Using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, the system can recognize attributes such as upper body color, what the person is wearing, accessories they are wearing, headgear, etc., and analyze behavior through cameras installed around the city.
## QA:
coming soon
