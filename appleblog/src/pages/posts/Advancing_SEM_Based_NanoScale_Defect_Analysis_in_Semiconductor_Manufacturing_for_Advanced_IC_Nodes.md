## abstracts:
In this research, we introduce a unified end-to-end Automated Defect Classification-Detection-Segmentation (ADCDS) framework for classifying, detecting, and segmenting multiple instances of semiconductor defects for advanced nodes. This framework consists of two modules: (a) a defect detection module, followed by (b) a defect segmentation module. The defect detection module employs Deformable DETR to aid in the classification and detection of nano-scale defects, while the segmentation module utilizes BoxSnake. BoxSnake facilitates box-supervised instance segmentation of nano-scale defects, supported by the former module. This simplifies the process by eliminating the laborious requirement for ground-truth pixel-wise mask annotation by human experts, which is typically associated with training conventional segmentation models. We have evaluated the performance of our ADCDS framework using two distinct process datasets from real wafers, as ADI and AEI, specifically focusing on Line-space patterns. We have demonstrated the applicability and significance of our proposed methodology, particularly in the nano-scale segmentation and generation of binary defect masks, using the challenging ADI SEM dataset where ground-truth pixelwise segmentation annotations were unavailable. Furthermore, we have presented a comparative analysis of our proposed framework against previous approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness. Our proposed framework achieved an overall mAP@IoU0.5 of 72.19 for detection and 78.86 for segmentation on the ADI dataset. Similarly, for the AEI dataset, these metrics were 90.38 for detection and 95.48 for segmentation. Thus, our proposed framework effectively fulfils the requirements of advanced defect analysis while addressing significant constraints.
