## abstracts:
We obtain the Hawking spectrum by exponentiating a series of Feynman diagrams describing a scalar field scattering through a collapse background. Our approach is rooted in semiclassical methods of scattering amplitudes which have recently been developed for application to gravitational-wave physics. The diagrams we encounter do not compute a standard amplitude, but rather an in-in generalisation of an amplitude which is closely connected to the Bogoliubov coefficients. We also compute the subdominant one-loop correction in our perturbative approach, analogous to the triangle correction to Schwarzschild scattering. This term can be interpreted as a finite-size correction sensitive to the radius of the black hole.
