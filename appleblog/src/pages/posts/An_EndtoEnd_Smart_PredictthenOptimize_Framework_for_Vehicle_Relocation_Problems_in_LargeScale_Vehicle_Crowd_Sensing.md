## abstracts:
Ubiquitous mobile devices have catalyzed the development of vehicle crowd sensing (VCS). In particular, vehicle sensing systems show great potential in the flexible acquisition of spatio-temporal urban data through built-in sensors under diverse sensing scenarios. However, vehicle systems often exhibit biased coverage due to the heterogeneous nature of trip requests and routes. To achieve a high sensing coverage, a critical challenge lies in optimally relocating vehicles to minimize the divergence between vehicle distributions and target sensing distributions. Conventional approaches typically employ a two-stage predict-then-optimize (PTO) process: first predicting real-time vehicle distributions and subsequently generating an optimal relocation strategy based on the predictions. However, this approach can lead to suboptimal decision-making due to the propagation of errors from upstream prediction. To this end, we develop an end-to-end Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) framework by integrating optimization into prediction within the deep learning architecture, and the entire framework is trained by minimizing the task-specific matching divergence rather than the upstream prediction error. Methodologically, we formulate the vehicle relocation problem by quadratic programming (QP) and incorporate a novel unrolling approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) within the SPO framework to compute gradients of the QP layer, facilitating backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by real-world taxi datasets in Hong Kong. Utilizing the alternating differentiation method, the general SPO framework presents a novel concept of addressing decision-making problems with uncertainty, demonstrating significant potential for advancing applications in intelligent transportation systems.
