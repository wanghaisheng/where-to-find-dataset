## abstracts:
This report characterized the suitability of existing datasets for devising new Machine Learning models, decision making methods, and analysis algorithms to improve Collaborative Problem Solving and then enumerated requirements for future datasets to be devised. Problem solving was assumed to be performed in teams of about three, four members, which talked to each other. A dataset consists of the speech recordings of such teams. The characterization methodology was based on metrics that capture cognitive, social, and emotional activities and situations. The report presented the analysis of a large group of datasets developed for Spoken Language Understanding, a research area with some similarity to Collaborative Problem Solving.
