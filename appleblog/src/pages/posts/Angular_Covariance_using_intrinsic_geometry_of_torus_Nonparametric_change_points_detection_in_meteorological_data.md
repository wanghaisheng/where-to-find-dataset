## abstracts:
In many temporal datasets, the parameters of the underlying distribution may change abruptly at unknown times. Detecting these changepoints is crucial for numerous applications. While this problem has been extensively studied for linear data, there has been remarkably less research on bivariate angular data. For the first time, we address the changepoint problem for the mean direction of toroidal and spherical data, which are types of bivariate angular data. By leveraging the intrinsic geometry of a curved torus, we introduce the concept of the ``square'' of an angle. This leads us to define the ``curved dispersion matrix'' for bivariate angular random variables, analogous to the dispersion matrix for bivariate linear random variables. Using this analogous measure of the ``Mahalanobis distance,'' we develop two new non-parametric tests to identify changes in the mean direction parameters for toroidal and spherical distributions. We derive the limiting distributions of the test statistics and evaluate their power surface and contours through extensive simulations. We also apply the proposed methods to detect changes in mean direction for hourly wind-wave direction measurements and the path of the cyclonic storm ``Biporjoy,'' which occurred between 6th and 19th June 2023 over the Arabian Sea, western coast of India.
