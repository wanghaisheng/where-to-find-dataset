## abstracts:
In this paper a relation between entangled states and geometry is studied. In particular, the area of 2D parallelogram is obtained from an entangled 4-qubit state. In addition, the vector area of a 3D parallelogram is derived from entangled 6-qubit states. Moreover, the volume of a 3D parallelepiped is deduced from an entangled 9-qubit state. Furthermore, it has been provided the quantum circuit in qiskit code for these entangled states. It is worth mentioning that parallelograms and parallelepipeds serve as fundamental building blocks for more sophisticated geometric structures.
