## abstracts:
This paper introduces a novel supervised classification strategy that integrates functional data analysis (FDA) with tree-based methods, addressing the challenges of high-dimensional data and enhancing the classification performance of existing functional classifiers. Specifically, we propose augmented versions of functional classification trees and functional random forests, incorporating a new tool for assessing the importance of functional principal components. This tool provides an ad-hoc method for determining unbiased permutation feature importance in functional data, particularly when dealing with correlated features derived from successive derivatives. Our study demonstrates that these additional features can significantly enhance the predictive power of functional classifiers. Experimental evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, yielding promising results compared to existing methods.
