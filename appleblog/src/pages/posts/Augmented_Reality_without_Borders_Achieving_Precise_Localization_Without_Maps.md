## abstracts:
Visual localization is crucial for Computer Vision and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, where determining the camera or device's position and orientation is essential to accurately interact with the physical environment. Traditional methods rely on detailed 3D maps constructed using Structure from Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is computationally expensive and impractical for dynamic or large-scale environments. We introduce MARLOC, a novel localization framework for AR applications that uses known relative transformations within image sequences to perform intra-sequence triangulation, generating 3D-2D correspondences for pose estimation and refinement. MARLOC eliminates the need for pre-built SfM maps, providing accurate and efficient localization suitable for dynamic outdoor environments. Evaluation with benchmark datasets and real-world experiments demonstrates MARLOC's state-of-the-art performance and robustness. By integrating MARLOC into an AR device, we highlight its capability to achieve precise localization in real-world outdoor scenarios, showcasing its practical effectiveness and potential to enhance visual localization in AR applications.
