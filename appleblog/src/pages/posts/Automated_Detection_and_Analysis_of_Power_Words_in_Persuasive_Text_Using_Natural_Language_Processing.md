## abstracts:
Power words are terms that evoke strong emotional responses and significantly influence readers' behavior, playing a crucial role in fields like marketing, politics, and motivational writing. This study proposes a methodology for the automated detection and analysis of power words in persuasive text using a custom lexicon and the TextBlob library in Python. By identifying the presence and frequency of power words within a given text, we aim to classify and analyze their impact on sentiment and reader engagement. This research examines diverse datasets across various domains to provide insights into the effectiveness of power words, offering practical applications for content creators, advertisers, and policymakers.
