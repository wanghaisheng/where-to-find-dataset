## abstracts:
Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that consider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only related to global object symmetries. However, as previously observed [26], visual ambiguities can also happen depending on the viewpoint or the presence of occluding objects, when disambiguating parts become hidden. The visual ambiguities are therefore actually different across images. We thus first propose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose distribution specific to each image, taking into account the visibility of the object surface in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities. Given this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art methods and show this greatly modify the ranking of these methods. Our annotations also allow us to benchmark recent methods able to estimate a pose distribution on real images for the first time. We will make our annotations for the T-LESS dataset and our code publicly available.
## QA:
coming soon
