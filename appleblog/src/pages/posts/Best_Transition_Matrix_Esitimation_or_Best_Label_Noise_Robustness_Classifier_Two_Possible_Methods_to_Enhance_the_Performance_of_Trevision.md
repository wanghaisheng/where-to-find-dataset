## abstracts:
Label noise refers to incorrect labels in a dataset caused by human errors or collection defects, which is common in real-world applications and can significantly reduce the accuracy of models. This report explores how to estimate noise transition matrices and construct deep learning classifiers that are robust against label noise. In cases where the transition matrix is known, we apply forward correction and importance reweighting methods to correct the impact of label noise using the transition matrix. When the transition matrix is unknown or inaccurate, we use the anchor point assumption and T-Revision series methods to estimate or correct the noise matrix. In this study, we further improved the T-Revision method by developing T-Revision-Alpha and T-Revision-Softmax to enhance stability and robustness. Additionally, we designed and implemented two baseline classifiers, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and ResNet-18, based on the cross-entropy loss function. We compared the performance of these methods on predicting clean labels and estimating transition matrices using the FashionMINIST dataset with known noise transition matrices. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, where the noise transition matrix is unknown, we estimated the noise matrix and evaluated the ability of the methods to predict clean labels.
