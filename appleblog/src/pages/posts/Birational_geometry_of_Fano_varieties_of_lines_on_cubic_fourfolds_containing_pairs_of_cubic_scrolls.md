## abstracts:
We characterize the birational geometry of some hyperk\"ahler fourfolds of Picard rank $3$ obtained as the Fano varieties of lines on cubic fourfolds containing pairs of cubic scrolls. In each of the two cases considered, we provide a census of the birational models, relating each model to familiar geometric constructions. We also provide structural results about the birational automorphism groups, giving generators in both cases and a full set of relations in one case. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain non-isomorphic cubic fourfolds whose Fano varieties of lines are birationally equivalent.
