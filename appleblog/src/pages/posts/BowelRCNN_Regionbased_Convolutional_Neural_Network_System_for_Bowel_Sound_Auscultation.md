## abstracts:
Sound events representing intestinal activity detection is a diagnostic tool with potential to identify gastrointestinal conditions. This article introduces BowelRCNN, a novel bowel sound detection system that uses audio recording, spectrogram analysys and region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture. The system was trained and validated on a real recording dataset gathered from 19 patients, comprising 60 minutes of prepared and annotated audio data. BowelRCNN achieved a classification accuracy of 96% and an F1 score of 71%. This research highlights the feasibility of using CNN architectures for bowel sound auscultation, achieving results comparable to those of recurrent-convolutional methods.
## QA:
