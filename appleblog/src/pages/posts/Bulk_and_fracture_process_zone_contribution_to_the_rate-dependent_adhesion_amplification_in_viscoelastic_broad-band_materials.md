## abstracts:
The contact between a rigid Hertzian indenter and an adhesive broad-band viscoelastic substrate is considered. The material behaviour is described by a modified power law model, which is characterized by only four parameters, the glassy and rubbery elastic moduli, a characteristic exponent n and a timescale ${\tau}_0$. The maximum adherence force that can be reached while unloading the rigid indenter from a relaxed viscoelastic half-space is studied by means of a numerical implementation based on the boundary element method, as a function of the unloading velocity, preload and by varying the broadness of the viscoelastic material spectrum. Through a comprehensive numerical analysis we have determined the minimum contact radius that is needed to achieve the maximum amplification of the pull-off force at a specified unloading rate and for different material exponents n. The numerical results are then compared with the prediction of Persson and Brener viscoelastic crack propagation theory, providing excellent agreement. However, comparison against experimental tests for a glass lens indenting a PDMS substrate show data can be fitted with the linear theory only up to an unloading rate of about $100 \textrm{ $\mu$}$m/s showing the fracture process zone rate-dependent contribution to the energy enhancement is of the same order of the bulk dissipation contribution. Hence, the limitations of the current numerical and theoretical models for viscoelastic adhesion are discussed in light of the most recent literature results.
