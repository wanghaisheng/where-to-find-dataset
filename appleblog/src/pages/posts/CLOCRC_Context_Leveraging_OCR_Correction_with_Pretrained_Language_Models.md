## abstracts:
The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.
