## abstracts:
In this paper, we introduce CloserMusicDB, a collection of full length studio quality tracks annotated by a team of human experts. We describe the selected qualities of our dataset, along with three example tasks possible to perform using this dataset: hook detection, contextual tagging and artist identification. We conduct baseline experiments and provide initial benchmarks for these tasks.
## QA:
coming soon
