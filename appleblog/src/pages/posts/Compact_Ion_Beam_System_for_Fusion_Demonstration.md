## abstracts:
We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.
