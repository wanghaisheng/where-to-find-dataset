## abstracts:
Dialogue separation involves isolating a dialogue signal from a mixture, such as a movie or a TV program. This can be a necessary step to enable dialogue enhancement for broadcast-related applications. In this paper, ConcateNet for dialogue separation is proposed, which is based on a novel approach for processing local and global features aimed at better generalization for out-of-domain signals. ConcateNet is trained using a noise reduction-focused, publicly available dataset and evaluated using three datasets: two noise reduction-focused datasets (in-domain), which show competitive performance for ConcateNet, and a broadcast-focused dataset (out-of-domain), which verifies the better generalization performance for the proposed architecture compared to considered state-of-the-art noise-reduction methods.
## QA:
