## abstracts:
This paper introduces Conformal Thresholded Intervals (CTI), a novel conformal regression method that aims to produce the smallest possible prediction set with guaranteed coverage. Unlike existing methods that rely on nested conformal framework and full conditional distribution estimation, CTI estimates the conditional probability density for a new response to fall into each interquantile interval using off-the-shelf multi-output quantile regression. CTI constructs prediction sets by thresholding the estimated conditional interquantile intervals based on their length, which is inversely proportional to the estimated probability density. The threshold is determined using a calibration set to ensure marginal coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that CTI achieves optimal performance across various datasets.
