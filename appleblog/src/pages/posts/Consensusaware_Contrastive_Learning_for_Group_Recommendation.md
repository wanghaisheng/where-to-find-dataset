## abstracts:
Group recommendation aims to provide personalized item suggestions to a group of users by reflecting their collective preferences. A fundamental challenge in this task is deriving a consensus that adequately represents the diverse interests of individual group members. Despite advancements made by deep learning-based models, existing approaches still struggle in two main areas: (1) Capturing consensus in small-group settings, which are more prevalent in real-world applications, and (2) Balancing individual preferences with overall group performance, particularly in hypergraph-based methods that tend to emphasize group accuracy at the expense of personalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a Consensus-aware Contrastive Learning for Group Recommendation (CoCoRec) that models group consensus through contrastive learning. CoCoRec utilizes a transformer encoder to jointly learn user and group representations, enabling richer modeling of intra-group dynamics. Additionally, the contrastive objective helps reduce overfitting from high-frequency user interactions, leading to more robust and representative group embeddings. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that CoCoRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both individual and group recommendation scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of consensus-aware contrastive learning in group recommendation tasks.
