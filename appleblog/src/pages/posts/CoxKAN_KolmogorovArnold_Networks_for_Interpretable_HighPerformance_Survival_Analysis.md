## abstracts:
Survival analysis is a branch of statistics used for modeling the time until a specific event occurs and is widely used in medicine, engineering, finance, and many other fields. When choosing survival models, there is typically a trade-off between performance and interpretability, where the highest performance is achieved by black-box models based on deep learning. This is a major problem in fields such as medicine where practitioners are reluctant to blindly trust black-box models to make important patient decisions. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were recently proposed as an interpretable and accurate alternative to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We introduce CoxKAN, a Cox proportional hazards Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for interpretable, high-performance survival analysis. We evaluate the proposed CoxKAN on 4 synthetic datasets and 9 real medical datasets. The synthetic experiments demonstrate that CoxKAN accurately recovers interpretable symbolic formulae for the hazard function, and effectively performs automatic feature selection. Evaluation on the 9 real datasets show that CoxKAN consistently outperforms the Cox proportional hazards model and achieves performance that is superior or comparable to that of tuned MLPs. Furthermore, we find that CoxKAN identifies complex interactions between predictor variables that would be extremely difficult to recognise using existing survival methods, and automatically finds symbolic formulae which uncover the precise effect of important biomarkers on patient risk.
