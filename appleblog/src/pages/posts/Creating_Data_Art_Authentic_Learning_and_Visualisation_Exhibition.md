## abstracts:
We present an authentic learning task designed for computing students, centred on the creation of data-art visualisations from chosen datasets for a public exhibition. This exhibition was showcased in the cinema foyer for two weeks in June, providing a real-world platform for students to display their work. Over the course of two years, we implemented this active learning task with two different cohorts of students. In this paper, we share our experiences and insights from these activities, highlighting the impact on student engagement and learning outcomes. We also provide a detailed description of the seven individual tasks that learners must perform: topic and data selection and analysis, research and art inspiration, design conceptualisation, proposed solution, visualisation creation, exhibition curation, and reflection. By integrating these tasks, students not only develop technical skills but also gain practical experience in presenting their work to a public audience, bridging the gap between academic learning and professional practice.
