## abstracts:
Edge detection, as a fundamental task in computer vision, has garnered increasing attention. The advent of deep learning has significantly advanced this field. However, recent deep learning-based methods which rely on large-scale pre-trained weights cannot be trained from scratch, with very limited research addressing this issue. This paper proposes a novel cycle pixel difference convolution (CPDC), which effectively integrates image gradient information with modern convolution operations. Based on the CPDC, we develop a U-shape encoder-decoder model named CPD-Net, which is a purely end-to-end network. Additionally, to address the issue of edge thickness produced by most existing methods, we construct a multi-scale information enhancement module (MSEM) to enhance the discriminative ability of the model, thereby generating crisp and clean contour maps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS=0.813), NYUD-V2 (ODS=0.760), and BIPED dataset (ODS=0.898). Our approach provides a novel perspective for addressing these challenges in edge detection.
