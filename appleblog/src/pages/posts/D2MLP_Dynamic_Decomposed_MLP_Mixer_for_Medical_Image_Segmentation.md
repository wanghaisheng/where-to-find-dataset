## abstracts:
Convolutional neural networks are widely used in various segmentation tasks in medical images. However, they are challenged to learn global features adaptively due to the inherent locality of convolutional operations. In contrast, MLP Mixers are proposed as a backbone to learn global information across channels with low complexity. However, they cannot capture spatial features efficiently. Additionally, they lack effective mechanisms to fuse and mix features adaptively. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Decomposed Mixer module. It is designed to employ novel Mixers to extract features and aggregate information across different spatial locations and channels. Additionally, it employs novel dynamic mixing mechanisms to model inter-dependencies between channel and spatial feature representations and to fuse them adaptively. Subsequently, we incorporate it into a U-shaped Transformer-based architecture to generate a novel network, termed the Dynamic Decomposed MLP Mixer. We evaluated it for medical image segmentation on two datasets, and it achieved superior segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art methods.
