## abstracts:
We study the problem of piecewise stationary bandits without prior knowledge of the underlying non-stationarity. We propose the first $\textit{feasible}$ black-box algorithm applicable to most common parametric bandit variants. Our procedure, termed Detection Augmented Bandit (DAB), is modular, accepting any stationary bandit algorithm as input and augmenting it with a change detector. DAB achieves optimal regret in the piecewise stationary setting under mild assumptions. Specifically, we prove that DAB attains the order-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N_T T})$, where $N_T$ denotes the number of changes over the horizon $T$, if its input stationary bandit algorithm has order-optimal stationary regret guarantees. Applying DAB to different parametric bandit settings, we recover recent state-of-the-art results. Notably, for self-concordant bandits, DAB achieves optimal dynamic regret, while previous works obtain suboptimal bounds and require knowledge on the non-stationarity. In simulations on piecewise stationary environments, DAB outperforms existing approaches across varying number of changes. Interestingly, despite being theoretically designed for piecewise stationary environments, DAB is also effective in simulations in drifting environments, outperforming existing methods designed specifically for this scenario.
