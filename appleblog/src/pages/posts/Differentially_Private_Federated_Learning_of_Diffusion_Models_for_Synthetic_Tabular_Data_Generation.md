## abstracts:
The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in finance necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold privacy standards. We introduce DP-Fed-FinDiff framework, a novel integration of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. This framework ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations while maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-Fed-FinDiff on multiple real-world financial datasets, achieving significant improvements in privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations, and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of DP-Fed-FinDiff to enable secure data sharing and robust analytics in highly regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning and privacy-preserving data synthesis.
