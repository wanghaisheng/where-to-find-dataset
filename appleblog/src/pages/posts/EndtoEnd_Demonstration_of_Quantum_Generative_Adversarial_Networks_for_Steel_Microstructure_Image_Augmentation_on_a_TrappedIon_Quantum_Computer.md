## abstracts:
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a machine learning technique capable of producing high-quality synthetic images. In the field of materials science, when a crystallographic dataset includes inadequate or difficult-to-obtain images, synthetic images can be used for image augmentation to mitigate data scarcity and streamline the preparation of datasets for high-throughput analysis. We integrate quantum computing with GANs into a hybrid quantum-classical GAN to generate complex 5-channel electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) images of two distinct microstructure phases of steel. By training a quantum circuit at the input layer of a large classical Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) model, we mitigate mode collapse and achieve higher image quality compared to a baseline classical GAN. We generate images from both ferrite and bainite microstructure phases in an end-to-end workflow. With respect to maximum mean discrepancy score, we find that the hybrid quantum-classical WGAN improves over classical Bernoulli GANs in 70% of samples. As the quantum computer is part of the training procedure, our method has potential to scale to larger number of qubits. Our results indicate that the WGAN model based on the quantum circuit ansatz may be effectively leveraged to enhance the quality of synthetic EBSD images on both quantum simulators and actual quantum hardware.
