## abstracts:
Platinum, Silver-Platinum embedded Zirconia (Pt/Ag-Pt ZrO2) thin films have been fabricated on silicon wafers and glass substrates using the plasma co-sputtering method. Zirconia thin films are of significant technological importance due to their remarkable electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, as well as their high melting temperature of 2715{\deg}C, which makes them increasingly attractive for various applications. In this study, ZrO2 thin films were deposited for 3 minutes, followed by the deposition of Pt-Ag/Pt onto the fabricated zirconia thin films, with deposition times ranging from 15 to 60 seconds. The varying deposition times of Pt-Ag/Pt influenced the optical and electronic properties of the thin films due to alterations in their surface roughness. The characteristics of the grown zirconia and Pt/Ag-Pt sputtered zirconia nanostructures were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical transmittance of these thin films was examined across the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. The investigation revealed various properties, such as enhanced photoluminescence and the emergence of new peaks in the visible range spectra. Plasmonic peaks were induced, and an increase in the sharpness of these peaks was observed between 403.15 nm and 512.10 nm for the Pt/Ag-Pt deposited samples. This enhancement in photoluminescence is attributed to the plasmonic properties of Pt-Ag nanoparticles on the zirconia thin film. The study demonstrates that these optically tuned thin film coatings, with their enhanced photoluminescence properties, can significantly improve the heat-resistance capacity of devices, mitigating issues related to overheating and device shutdown.
