## abstracts:
Tracking the evolution of smart contracts is challenging due to their immutable nature and complex upgrade mechanisms. We introduce EvoChain, a comprehensive framework and dataset designed to track and visualize smart contract evolution. Building upon data from our previous empirical study, EvoChain models contract relationships using a Neo4j graph database and provides an interactive web interface for exploration. The framework consists of a data layer, an API layer, and a user interface layer. EvoChain allows stakeholders to analyze contract histories, upgrade paths, and associated vulnerabilities by leveraging these components. Our dataset encompasses approximately 1.3 million upgradeable proxies and nearly 15,000 historical versions, enhancing transparency and trust in blockchain ecosystems by providing an accessible platform for understanding smart contract evolution.
## QA:
coming soon
