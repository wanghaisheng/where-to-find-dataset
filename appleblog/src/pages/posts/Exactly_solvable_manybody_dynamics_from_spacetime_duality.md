## abstracts:
Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.
