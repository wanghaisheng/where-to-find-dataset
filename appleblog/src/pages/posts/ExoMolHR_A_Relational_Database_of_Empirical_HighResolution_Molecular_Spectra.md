## abstracts:
ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.
## QA:
coming soon
