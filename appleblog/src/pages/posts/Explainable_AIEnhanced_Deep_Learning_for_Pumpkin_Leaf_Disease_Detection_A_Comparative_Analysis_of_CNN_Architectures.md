## abstracts:
Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity, requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error, emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the "Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate treatments.
