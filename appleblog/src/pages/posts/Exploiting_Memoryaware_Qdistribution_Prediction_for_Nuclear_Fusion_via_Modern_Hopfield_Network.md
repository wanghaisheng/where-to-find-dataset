## abstracts:
This study addresses the critical challenge of predicting the Q-distribution in long-term stable nuclear fusion task, a key component for advancing clean energy solutions. We introduce an innovative deep learning framework that employs Modern Hopfield Networks to incorporate associative memory from historical shots. Utilizing a newly compiled dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing Q-distribution prediction. The proposed method represents a significant advancement by leveraging historical memory information for the first time in this context, showcasing improved prediction accuracy and contributing to the optimization of nuclear fusion research.
