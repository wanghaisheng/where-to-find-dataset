## abstracts:
Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-vision, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), tasks have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I GMs are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to generate disruptive outputs semantically related to those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of VLP tasks when injected into images. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs. To better observe performance modifications and characteristics of this threat, we also introduce the TVPI Dataset. Through extensive explorations, we deepen the understanding of the underlying causes of the TVPI threat in various GMs and offer valuable insights into its potential origins.
