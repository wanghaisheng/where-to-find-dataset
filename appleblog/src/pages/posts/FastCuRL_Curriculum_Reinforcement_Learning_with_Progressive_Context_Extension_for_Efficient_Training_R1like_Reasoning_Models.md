## abstracts:
In this paper, we propose \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}}, a simple yet efficient \textbf{Cu}rriculum \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning approach with context window extending strategy to accelerate the reinforcement learning training efficiency for R1-like reasoning models while enhancing their performance in tackling complex reasoning tasks with long chain-of-thought rationales, particularly with a 1.5B parameter language model. \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}} consists of two main procedures: length-aware training data segmentation and context window extension training. Specifically, the former first splits the original training data into three different levels by the input prompt length, and then the latter leverages segmented training datasets with a progressively increasing context window length to train the reasoning model. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{\textsc{FastCuRL}}-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview across all five datasets (including MATH 500, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, Minerva Math, and OlympiadBench) while only utilizing 50\% of training steps. Furthermore, all training stages for FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview are completed using just a single node with 8 GPUs.
