## abstracts:
Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging field for recognizing fine-grained parts in unseen categories. We identify two primary challenges in OVPS: (1) the difficulty in aligning part-level image-text correspondence, and (2) the lack of structural understanding in segmenting object parts. To address these issues, we propose PartCATSeg, a novel framework that integrates object-aware part-level cost aggregation, compositional loss, and structural guidance from DINO. Our approach employs a disentangled cost aggregation strategy that handles object and part-level costs separately, enhancing the precision of part-level segmentation. We also introduce a compositional loss to better capture part-object relationships, compensating for the limited part annotations. Additionally, structural guidance from DINO features improves boundary delineation and inter-part understanding. Extensive experiments on Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, setting a new baseline for robust generalization to unseen part categories.
