## abstracts:
We investigate the constraining power of future CMB and galaxy surveys on models of quintessential inflation realized within the framework of $\alpha$-attractors. We analyze how these future datasets will probe the parameter space of $\alpha$-attractor quintessential inflation, specifically the inflationary potential parameters. Our results demonstrate that the synergy between CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and Euclid can significantly tighten the bounds on the model parameters, achieving forecasted $1\sigma$ uncertainties of $\alpha=2\pm 0.17$, $n_s=0.965\pm 0.0014$, $\ln(10^{10}A_s)=3.0447\pm 0.0029$ for the CMB+GC$_{sp}$ case. This level of sensitivity will enable us to discriminate between different realizations of quintessential inflation and test the attractor behavior characteristic of these models.
