## abstracts:
We present GEOPARD, a transformer-based architecture for predicting articulation from a single static snapshot of a 3D shape. The key idea of our method is a pretraining strategy that allows our transformer to learn plausible candidate articulations for 3D shapes based on a geometric-driven search without manual articulation annotation. The search automatically discovers physically valid part motions that do not cause detachments or collisions with other shape parts. Our experiments indicate that this geometric pretraining strategy, along with carefully designed choices in our transformer architecture, yields state-of-the-art results in articulation inference in the PartNet-Mobility dataset.
