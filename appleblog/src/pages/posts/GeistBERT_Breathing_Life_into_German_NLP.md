## abstracts:
Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context, German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification (GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.
