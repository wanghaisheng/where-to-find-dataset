## abstracts:
Imitation based robot learning has recently gained significant attention in the robotics field due to its theoretical potential for transferability and generalizability. However, it remains notoriously costly, both in terms of hardware and data collection, and deploying it in real-world environments demands meticulous setup of robots and precise experimental conditions. In this paper, we present a low-cost robot learning framework that is both easily reproducible and transferable to various robots and environments. We demonstrate that deployable imitation learning can be successfully applied even to industrial-grade robots, not just expensive collaborative robotic arms. Furthermore, our results show that multi-task robot learning is achievable with simple network architectures and fewer demonstrations than previously thought necessary. As the current evaluating method is almost subjective when it comes to real-world manipulation tasks, we propose Voting Positive Rate (VPR) - a novel evaluation strategy that provides a more objective assessment of performance. We conduct an extensive comparison of success rates across various self-designed tasks to validate our approach. To foster collaboration and support the robot learning community, we have open-sourced all relevant datasets and model checkpoints, available at huggingface.co/ZhiChengAI.
