## abstracts:
This paper describes spatially aware Artificial Intelligence, GeoAI, tailored for small organizations such as NGOs in resource constrained contexts where access to large datasets, expensive compute infrastructure and AI expertise may be restricted. We furthermore consider future scenarios in which resource-intensive, large geospatial models may homogenize the representation of complex landscapes, and suggest strategies to prepare for this condition.
## QA:
coming soon
