## abstracts:
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative model training without centralized data aggregation, enhancing privacy and resilience. However, its sustainability remains underexplored, as energy consumption and carbon emissions vary across different system configurations. Understanding the environmental impact of DFL is crucial for optimizing its design and deployment. This study aims to assess the sustainability of DFL systems by analyzing factors that influence energy consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, it proposes sustainability-aware optimization strategies, including a node selection algorithm and an aggregation method, to reduce the environmental footprint of DFL without compromising model performance. The proposed framework, named GreenDFL, systematically evaluates the impact of hardware accelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution, network topology, and federation size on sustainability. Empirical experiments are conducted on multiple datasets using different system configurations, measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions across various phases of the DFL lifecycle. Results indicate that local training dominates energy consumption and carbon emissions, while communication has a relatively minor impact. Optimizing model complexity, using GPUs instead of CPUs, and strategically selecting participating nodes significantly improve sustainability. Additionally, deploying nodes in regions with lower carbon intensity and integrating early stopping mechanisms further reduce emissions. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive and practical computational approach for assessing the sustainability of DFL systems. Furthermore, it offers best practices for improving environmental efficiency in DFL, making sustainability considerations more actionable in real-world deployments.
