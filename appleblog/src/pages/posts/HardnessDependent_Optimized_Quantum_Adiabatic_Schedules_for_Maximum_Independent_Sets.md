## abstracts:
We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient schedules for adiabatic quantum computing, focusing on the maximum independent set problem and on neutral atom platforms. Based on a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidences that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem and not on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard instances with more than 100 atoms using QuEra's quantum computer ``Aquila''. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solve the hardest problems with the current technology.
## QA:
coming soon
