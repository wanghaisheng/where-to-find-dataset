## abstracts:
In this paper we propose the Highly Adaptive Ridge (HAR): a regression method that achieves a $n^{-1/3}$ dimension-free L2 convergence rate in the class of right-continuous functions with square-integrable sectional derivatives. This is a large nonparametric function class that is particularly appropriate for tabular data. HAR is exactly kernel ridge regression with a specific data-adaptive kernel based on a saturated zero-order tensor-product spline basis expansion. We use simulation and real data to confirm our theory. We demonstrate empirical performance better than state-of-the-art algorithms for small datasets in particular.
## QA:
coming soon
