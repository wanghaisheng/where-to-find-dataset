## abstracts:
Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is often assumed to benefit from larger training datasets. This paper investigates the impact of tokenizer training data sizes ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as the data size increases, highlighting a practical limit on how much further scaling the training data can improve tokenization quality. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to the constraints imposed by the pre-tokenization stage of tokenization. These results offer valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process and highlight potential avenues for future research in tokenization algorithms.
