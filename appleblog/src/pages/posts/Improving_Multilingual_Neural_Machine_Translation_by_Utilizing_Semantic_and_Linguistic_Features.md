## abstracts:
The many-to-many multilingual neural machine translation can be regarded as the process of integrating semantic features from the source sentences and linguistic features from the target sentences. To enhance zero-shot translation, models need to share knowledge across languages, which can be achieved through auxiliary tasks for learning a universal representation or cross-lingual mapping. To this end, we propose to exploit both semantic and linguistic features between multiple languages to enhance multilingual translation. On the encoder side, we introduce a disentangling learning task that aligns encoder representations by disentangling semantic and linguistic features, thus facilitating knowledge transfer while preserving complete information. On the decoder side, we leverage a linguistic encoder to integrate low-level linguistic features to assist in the target language generation. Experimental results on multilingual datasets demonstrate significant improvement in zero-shot translation compared to the baseline system, while maintaining performance in supervised translation. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of our method in leveraging both semantic and linguistic features. The code is available at https://github.com/ictnlp/SemLing-MNMT.
