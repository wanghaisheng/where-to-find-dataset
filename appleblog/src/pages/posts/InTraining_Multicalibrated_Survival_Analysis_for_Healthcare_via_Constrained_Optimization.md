## abstracts:
Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.
