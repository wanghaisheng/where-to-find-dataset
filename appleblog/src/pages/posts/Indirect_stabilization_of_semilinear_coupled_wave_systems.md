## abstracts:
In this paper, we study the indirect stabilization problem for a system of two coupled semilinear wave equations with internal damping in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical, defocusing and analytic. Under geometric control condition on both coupling and damping regions, we establish the exponential energy decay rate.
