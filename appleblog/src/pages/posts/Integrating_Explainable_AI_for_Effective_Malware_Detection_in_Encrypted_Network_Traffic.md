## abstracts:
Encrypted network communication ensures confidentiality, integrity, and privacy between endpoints. However, attackers are increasingly exploiting encryption to conceal malicious behavior. Detecting unknown encrypted malicious traffic without decrypting the payloads remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to detect malicious network traffic. We employ ensemble learning models to identify malicious activity using multi-view features extracted from various aspects of encrypted communication. To effectively represent malicious communication, we compiled a robust dataset with 1,127 unique connections, more than any other available open-source dataset, and spanning 54 malware families. Our models were benchmarked against the CTU-13 dataset, achieving performance of over 99% accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model demonstrated 99.32% accuracy, 99.53% precision, and 99.43% F1-score on our custom dataset. By leveraging Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we identified that the maximum packet size, mean inter-arrival time of packets, and transport layer security version used are the most critical features for the global model explanation. Furthermore, key features were identified as important for local explanations across both datasets for individual traffic samples. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the model decision-making process, enhancing the transparency and reliability of detecting malicious encrypted traffic.
