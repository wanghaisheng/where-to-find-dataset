## abstracts:
Low carrier densities in topological semimetals (TSMs) enable the exploration of novel magnetotransport in the quantum limit (QL). Reports consistent with 3D quasi-quantum Hall effect (QQHE) have repositioned TSMs as promising platforms for exploring 3D quantum Hall transport, but the lack of tunability in the Fermi has thus far limited the ability to control the QQHE signal. Here, we tune the defect concentrations in the Dirac semimetal Cd${}_3$As${}_2$ to achieve ultra-low carrier concentrations at 2 K around $2.9\times10^{16}$cm${}^{-3}$, giving way to QQHE signal at modest fields under 10 T. At low carrier densities, where QQHE is most accessible, we find that a zero resistivity state is obscured by a carrier density dependent background originating from Coulomb disorder from charged point defects. Our results highlight the interplay between QQHE and Coulomb disorder scattering, demonstrating that clear observation of QQHE in TSMs intricately depends on Fermi level. Predicted in TSMs a decade ago, we find that Coulomb disorder is an essential ingredient for understanding the magnetoresistivity for a spectrum of Fermi levels, experimentally anchoring the important roles of defects and charged disorder in TSM applications. We discuss future constraints and opportunities in exploring 3D QHE in TSMs.
