## abstracts:
Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain black hole masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multi-color disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a black hole mass at $M \simeq 10^{5.5}~M_{\odot}$, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear black hole population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred black hole masses are $\sim$ 0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast $v_{\mathrm{out}} = -0.2~c$ outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of $\dot{M} \simeq 5~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.
