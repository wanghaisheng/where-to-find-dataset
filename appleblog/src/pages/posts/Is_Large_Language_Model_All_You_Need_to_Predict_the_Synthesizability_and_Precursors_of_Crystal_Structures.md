## abstracts:
Accessing the synthesizability of crystal structures is pivotal for advancing the practical application of theoretical material structures designed by machine learning or high-throughput screening. However, a significant gap exists between the actual synthesizability and thermodynamic or kinetic stability, which is commonly used for screening theoretical structures for experiments. To address this, we develop the Crystal Synthesis Large Language Models (CSLLM) framework, which includes three LLMs for predicting the synthesizability, synthesis methods, and precursors. We create a comprehensive synthesizability dataset including 140,120 crystal structures and develop an efficient text representation method for crystal structures to fine-tune the LLMs. The Synthesizability LLM achieves a remarkable 98.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional synthesizability screening based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability by 106.1% and 44.5%, respectively. The Methods LLM achieves a classification accuracy of 91.02%, and the Precursors LLM has an 80.2% success rate in predicting synthesis precursors. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables automatic predictions of synthesizability and precursors from uploaded crystal structure files. Through these contributions, CSLLM bridges the gap between theoretical material design and experimental synthesis, paving the way for the rapid discovery of novel and synthesizable functional materials.
