## abstracts:
Purpose: The distribution of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in cystectomy patients is indicative of the incidence of post-operative complications. Existing VAT segmentation methods for computed tomography (CT) employing intensity thresholding have limitations relating to inter-observer variability. Moreover, the difficulty in creating ground-truth masks limits the development of deep learning (DL) models for this task. This paper introduces a novel method for VAT prediction in pre-cystectomy CT, which is fully automated and does not require ground-truth VAT masks for training, overcoming aforementioned limitations. Methods: We introduce the Kernel density Enhanced VAT Segmentator ( KEVS), combining a DL semantic segmentation model, for multi-body feature prediction, with Gaussian kernel density estimation analysis of predicted subcutaneous adipose tissue to achieve accurate scan-specific predictions of VAT in the abdominal cavity. Uniquely for a DL pipeline, KEVS does not require ground-truth VAT masks. Results: We verify the ability of KEVS to accurately segment abdominal organs in unseen CT data and compare KEVS VAT segmentation predictions to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in a dataset of 20 pre-cystectomy CT scans, collected from University College London Hospital (UCLH-Cyst), with expert ground-truth annotations. KEVS presents a 4.80% and 6.02% improvement in Dice Coefficient over the second best DL and thresholding-based VAT segmentation techniques respectively when evaluated on UCLH-Cyst. Conclusion: This research introduces KEVS; an automated, SOTA method for the prediction of VAT in pre-cystectomy CT which eliminates inter-observer variability and is trained entirely on open-source CT datasets which do not contain ground-truth VAT masks.
