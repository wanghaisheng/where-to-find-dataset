## abstracts:
A semidomain is a subsemiring of an integral domain. Within this class, a unique factorization semidomain (UFS) is characterized by the property that every nonzero, nonunit element can be factored into a product of finitely many prime elements. In this paper, we investigate the localization of semidomains, focusing specifically on UFSs. We demonstrate that the localization of a UFS remains a UFS, leading to the conclusion that a UFS is either a unique factorization domain or is additively reduced. In addition, we provide an example of a subsemiring $\mathfrak{S}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $(\mathfrak{S}, \cdot)$ and $(\mathfrak{S}, +)$ are both half-factorial, shedding light on a conjecture posed by Baeth, Chapman, and Gotti.
