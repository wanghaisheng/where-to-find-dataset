## abstracts:
This paper studies the long-term energy management of a microgrid coordinating hybrid hydrogen-battery energy storage. We develop an approximate semi-empirical hydrogen storage model to accurately capture the power-dependent efficiency of hydrogen storage. We introduce a prediction-free two-stage coordinated optimization framework, which generates the annual state-of-charge (SoC) reference for hydrogen storage offline. During online operation, it updates the SoC reference online using kernel regression and makes operation decisions based on the proposed adaptive virtual-queue-based online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm. We innovatively incorporate penalty terms for long-term pattern tracking and expert-tracking for step size updates. We provide theoretical proof to show that the proposed OCO algorithm achieves a sublinear bound of dynamic regret without using prediction information. Numerical studies based on the Elia and North China datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing online optimization approaches by reducing the operational costs and loss of load by around 30% and 80%, respectively. These benefits can be further enhanced with optimized settings for the penalty coefficient and step size of OCO, as well as more historical references.
