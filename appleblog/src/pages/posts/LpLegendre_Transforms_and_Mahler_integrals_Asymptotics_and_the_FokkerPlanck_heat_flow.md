## abstracts:
$L^p$-polarity and $L^p$-Mahler volumes were recently introduced by Berndtsson, Rubinstein, and the author as a new approach, inspired by complex geometry, to the Mahler, Bourgain, and Blocki conjectures. This paper serves two purposes. First, it introduces functional analogues of these notions and establishes functional versions of key theorems previously formulated in the setting of convex bodies. This involves introducing the $L^p$-Legendre transform and analyzing the associated Santal\'o points and the dimensional asymptotics of the Mahler volumes of conjectured extremizers. Second, the paper investigates the connection between the $L^p$-Legendre transform and the recent work of Nakamura--Tsuji on the Fokker--Planck heat flow. As a byproduct, a functional $L^p$-Santal\'o inequality is established. The proof is based on deriving the evolution equations for the $L^p$-Legendre transform and Mahler integral under the Fokker--Planck heat flow. A second approach, using the geometric method of Artstein--Klartag--Milman is also presented, for which the necessary asymptotics are derived in the $L^1$-case.
