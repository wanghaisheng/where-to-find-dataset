## abstracts:
Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), offer a unique advantage in control applications, due to their high temporal resolution, and asynchronous event-based data. Still, their adoption in machine learning algorithms remains limited. To address this gap, and promote the development of models that leverage the specific characteristics of DVS data, we introduce the Multi-Modal Dynamic-Vision-Sensor Line Following dataset (MMDVS-LF). This comprehensive dataset, is the first to integrate multiple sensor modalities, including DVS recordings, RGB video, odometry, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, from a small-scale standardized vehicle. Additionally, the dataset includes eye-tracking and demographic data of drivers performing a Line Following task on a track. With its diverse range of data, MMDVS-LF opens new opportunities for developing deep learning algorithms, and conducting data science projects across various domains, supporting innovation in autonomous systems and control applications.
