## abstracts:
We train machine learning models to predict the order of the Shafarevich-Tate group of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Building on earlier work of He, Lee, and Oliver, we show that a feed-forward neural network classifier trained on subsets of the invariants arising in the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjectural formula yields higher accuracies ($> 0.9$) than any model previously studied. In addition, we develop a regression model that may be used to predict orders of this group not seen during training and apply this to the elliptic curve of rank 29 recently discovered by Elkies and Klagsbrun. Finally we conduct some exploratory data analyses and visualizations on our dataset. We use the elliptic curve dataset from the L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB).
