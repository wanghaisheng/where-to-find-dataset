## abstracts:
With the wide application of IoT and industrial IoT technologies, the network structure is becoming more and more complex, and the traffic scale is growing rapidly, which makes the traditional security protection mechanism face serious challenges in dealing with high-frequency, diversified, and stealthy cyber-attacks. To address this problem, this study proposes MindFlow, a multi-dimensional dynamic traffic prediction and anomaly detection system combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long and short-term memory network (BiLSTM) architectures based on the MindSpore framework, and conducts systematic experiments on the NF-BoT-IoT dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 99% in key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, effectively verifying its accuracy and robustness in network intrusion detection.
## QA:
