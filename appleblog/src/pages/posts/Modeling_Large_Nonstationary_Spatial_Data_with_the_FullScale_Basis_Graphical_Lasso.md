## abstracts:
We propose a new approach for the modeling large datasets of nonstationary spatial processes that combines a latent low rank process and a sparse covariance model. The low rank component coefficients are endowed with a flexible graphical Gaussian Markov random field model. The utilization of a low rank and compactly-supported covariance structure combines the full-scale approximation and the basis graphical lasso; we term this new approach the full-scale basis graphical lasso (FSBGL). Estimation employs a graphical lasso-penalized likelihood, which is optimized using a difference-of-convex scheme. We illustrate the proposed approach with a challenging high-resolution simulation dataset of the thermosphere. In a comparison against state-of-the-art spatial models, the FSBGL performs better at capturing salient features of the thermospheric temperature fields, even with limited available training data.
