## abstracts:
Accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision are essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, the present Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approaches cannot extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently, proven to yield less accurate forecasts. Besides, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast inference for traffic forecasting. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by leveraging heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected baselines.
