## abstracts:
Human activity recognition is increasingly vital for supporting independent living, particularly for the elderly and those in need of assistance. Domestic service robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide essential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in the past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and sensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving. However, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing challenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise, they predominantly rely on "fixed" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly across all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that can dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local neighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an adaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single shared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates multiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature space. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global spatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying local features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human activity recognition. Our source code is made publicly available at: https://github.com/Gbouna/MAK-GCN
