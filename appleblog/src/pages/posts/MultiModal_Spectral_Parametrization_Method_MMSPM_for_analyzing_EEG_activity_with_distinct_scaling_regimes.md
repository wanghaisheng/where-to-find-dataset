## abstracts:
Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($<\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$).   Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.
