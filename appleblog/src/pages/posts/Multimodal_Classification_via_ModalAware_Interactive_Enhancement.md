## abstracts:
Due to the notorious modality imbalance problem, multimodal learning (MML) leads to the phenomenon of optimization imbalance, thus struggling to achieve satisfactory performance. Recently, some representative methods have been proposed to boost the performance, mainly focusing on adaptive adjusting the optimization of each modality to rebalance the learning speed of dominant and non-dominant modalities. To better facilitate the interaction of model information in multimodal learning, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning method, called modal-aware interactive enhancement (MIE). Specifically, we first utilize an optimization strategy based on sharpness aware minimization (SAM) to smooth the learning objective during the forward phase. Then, with the help of the geometry property of SAM, we propose a gradient modification strategy to impose the influence between different modalities during the backward phase. Therefore, we can improve the generalization ability and alleviate the modality forgetting phenomenon simultaneously for multimodal learning. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform various state-of-the-art baselines to achieve the best performance.
