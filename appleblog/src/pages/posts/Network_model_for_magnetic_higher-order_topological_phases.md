## abstracts:
We propose a network-model realization of magnetic higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) in the presence of the combined space-time symmetry $C_4\mathcal{T}$ -- the product of a fourfold rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We show that the system possesses two types of HOTPs. The first type, analogous to Floquet topology, generates a total of $8$ corner modes at $0$ or $\pi$ eigenphase, while the second type, hidden behind a weak topological phase, yields a unique phase with $8$ corner modes at $\pm\pi/2$ eigenphase (after gapping out the counterpropagating edge states), arising from the product of particle-hole and phase rotation symmetry. By using a bulk $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index ($Q$), we found both HOTPs have $Q=2$, whereas $Q=0$ for the trivial and the conventional weak topological phase. Together with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index associated with the reflection matrix, we are able to fully distinguish all phases. Our work motivates further studies on magnetic topological phases and symmetry protected $2\pi/n$ boundary modes, as well as suggests that such phases may find their experimental realization in coupled-ring-resonator networks.
