## abstracts:
In this paper, we present a novel keypoint-based classification model designed to recognise British Sign Language (BSL) words within continuous signing sequences. Our model's performance is assessed using the BOBSL dataset, revealing that the keypoint-based approach surpasses its RGB-based counterpart in computational efficiency and memory usage. Furthermore, it offers expedited training times and demands fewer computational resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the inaugural application of a keypoint-based model for BSL word classification, rendering direct comparisons with existing works unavailable.
