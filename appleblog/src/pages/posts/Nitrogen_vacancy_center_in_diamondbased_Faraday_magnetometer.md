## abstracts:
The nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond is a versatile color center widely used for magnetometry, quantum computing, and quantum communications. In this article, we develop a new magnetometer using an ensemble of nitrogen vacancy centers and the Faraday effect. The sensitivity of our magnetometer is $300~nT/ \sqrt{Hz}$. We argue that by using an optical cavity and a high purity diamond, sensitivities in the femtotesla level can be achieved.
## QA:
coming soon
