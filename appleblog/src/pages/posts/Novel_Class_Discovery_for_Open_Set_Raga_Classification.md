## abstracts:
The task of Raga classification in Indian Art Music (IAM) is constrained by the limited availability of labeled datasets, resulting in many Ragas being unrepresented during the training of machine learning models. Traditional Raga classification methods rely on supervised learning, and assume that for a test audio to be classified by a Raga classification model, it must have been represented in the training data, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where novel, unseen Ragas may appear. To address this limitation, we propose a method based on Novel Class Discovery (NCD) to detect and classify previously unseen Ragas. Our approach utilizes a feature extractor trained in a supervised manner to generate embeddings, which are then employed within a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised training, enabling the identification of previously unseen Raga classes. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect audio samples corresponding to these novel Ragas, offering a robust solution for utilizing the vast amount of unlabeled music data available online. This approach reduces the need for manual labeling while expanding the repertoire of recognized Ragas, and other music data in Music Information Retrieval (MIR).
