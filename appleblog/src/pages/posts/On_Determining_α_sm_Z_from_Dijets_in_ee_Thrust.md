## abstracts:
We update a previous N$^3$LL$^\prime$+${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ determination of the strong coupling from a global fit to thrust data by including newly available perturbative ingredients, upgrading the renormalization scales to include a fully canonical scaling region, and implementing the log resummation in a way which ensures the integrated cross section is unaffected by the the leading $1/Q$ hadronization power corrections. Detailed discussions are provided concerning the stability of the results under variations of the fit range and the importance of summing up higher-order logarithmic terms for convergence and stability. We show that high-precision results can be achieved even when carrying out a more conservative fit by restricting the dataset to a region which is more clearly dominated by dijet events. This leads to $\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1136 \pm 0.0012$ with $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=0.86$, fully compatible with earlier results using a larger fit range. We also demonstrate that a number of additional effects associated to power corrections have a small impact on this fit result, including modifications to the renormalon substraction scheme for dijet power corrections and the inclusion of three-jet power correction models. The fit is also shown to provide very good agreement with data outside the fit range.
