## abstracts:
Recent advances in cover song identification have shown great success. However, models are usually tested on a fixed set of datasets which are relying on the online cover song database SecondHandSongs. It is unclear how well models perform on cover songs on online video platforms, which might exhibit alterations that are not expected. In this paper, we annotate a subset of songs from YouTube sampled by a multi-modal uncertainty sampling approach and evaluate state-of-the-art models. We find that existing models achieve significantly lower ranking performance on our dataset compared to a community dataset. We additionally measure the performance of different types of versions (e.g., instrumental versions) and find several types that are particularly hard to rank. Lastly, we provide a taxonomy of alterations in cover versions on the web.
