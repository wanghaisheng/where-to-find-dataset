## abstracts:
The Cano-Ruip\'erez 4-dimensional string effective action is the simplest consistent truncation of the first-order in $\alpha'$ heterotic string effective action compactified on T$^{6}$. This theory contains, on top of the metric, a dilaton and an axion that couple to the Gauss-Bonnet term and to the Pontrjagin density which suggests a very strong relation between the physical and geometrical properties of its solutions. In this paper we study the thermodynamics of the string black-hole solutions of this theory using Wald's formalism. We construct the on-shell closed generalized Komar, dilaton and axion 2-form charges, and we used them to find the Smarr formula (that we test on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions) and to prove no-(primary)-hair theorems for the scalar. We find that $\alpha'$ plays the role of a thermodynamical variable with an associated chemical potential. We also notice the occurrence of non-standard gravitational charges in the Wald entropy and scalar charges.
