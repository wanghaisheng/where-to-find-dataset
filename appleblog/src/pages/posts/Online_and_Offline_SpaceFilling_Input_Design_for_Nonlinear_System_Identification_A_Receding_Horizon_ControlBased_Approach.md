## abstracts:
The effectiveness of data-driven techniques heavily depends on the input signal used to generate the estimation data. However, a significant research gap exists in the field of input design for nonlinear dynamic system identification. In particular, existing methods largely overlook the minimization of the generalization error, i.e., model inaccuracies in regions not covered by the estimation dataset. This work addresses this gap by proposing an input design method that embeds a novel optimality criterion within a receding horizon control (RHC)-based optimization framework. The distance-based optimality criterion induces a space-filling design within a user-defined region of interest in a surrogate model's input space, requiring only minimal prior knowledge. Additionally, the method is applicable both online, where model parameters are continuously updated based on process observations, and offline, where a fixed model is employed. The space-filling performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated on an artificial example and compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior efficiency in exploring process operating spaces.
