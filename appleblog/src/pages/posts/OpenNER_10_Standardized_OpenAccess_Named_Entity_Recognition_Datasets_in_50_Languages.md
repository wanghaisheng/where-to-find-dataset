## abstracts:
We present OpenNER 1.0, a standardized collection of openly available named entity recognition (NER) datasets. OpenNER contains 34 datasets spanning 51 languages, annotated in varying named entity ontologies. We correct annotation format issues, standardize the original datasets into a uniform representation, map entity type names to be more consistent across corpora, and provide the collection in a structure that enables research in multilingual and multi-ontology NER. We provide baseline models using three pretrained multilingual language models to compare the performance of recent models and facilitate future research in NER.
## QA:
coming soon
