## abstracts:
Recent advancements demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1 have shown that complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs), including sophisticated behaviors such as self-verification and self-correction, can be achieved by RL with verifiable rewards and significantly improves model performance on challenging tasks such as AIME. Motivated by these findings, our study investigates whether similar reasoning capabilities can be successfully integrated into large vision-language models (LVLMs) and assesses their impact on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks. We consider an approach that iteratively leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on lightweight training data and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to further improve model generalization. Initially, reasoning capabilities were distilled from pure-text R1 models by generating reasoning steps using high-quality captions of the images sourced from diverse visual datasets. Subsequently, iterative RL training further enhance reasoning skills, with each iteration's RL-improved model generating refined SFT datasets for the next round. This iterative process yielded OpenVLThinker, a LVLM exhibiting consistently improved reasoning performance on challenging benchmarks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision, demonstrating the potential of our strategy for robust vision-language reasoning. The code, model and data are held at https://github.com/yihedeng9/OpenVLThinker.
