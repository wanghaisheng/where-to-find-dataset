## abstracts:
Recent advances in structured 3D Gaussians for view-adaptive rendering, particularly through methods like Scaffold-GS, have demonstrated promising results in neural scene representation. However, existing approaches still face challenges in perceptual consistency and precise view-dependent effects. We present PEP-GS, a novel framework that enhances structured 3D Gaussians through three key innovations: (1) a Local-Enhanced Multi-head Self-Attention (LEMSA) mechanism that replaces spherical harmonics for more accurate view-dependent color decoding, and (2) Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) that optimize Gaussian opacity and covariance functions for enhanced interpretability and splatting precision. (3) a Neural Laplacian Pyramid Decomposition (NLPD) that improves perceptual similarity across views. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets indicates that, compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, these improvements are particularly evident in challenging scenarios such as view-dependent effects, specular reflections, fine-scale details and false geometry generation.
