## abstracts:
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect mHz gravitational waves from many astrophysical sources, including millions of compact binaries in the Galaxy, thousands of which may be individually resolvable. The large number of signals overlapping in the LISA dataset requires a global fit in which an unknown number of sources are modeled simultaneously. This introduces a label-switching ambiguity for sources in the same class, making it challenging to distill a traditional astronomical catalog from global-fit posteriors. We present a method to construct a catalog by optimally relabeling samples from the global-fit posterior to minimize the statistical divergence between the global fit and a factorized catalog representation. The resulting catalog consists of the source posterior distributions and their probabilities of having an astrophysical origin. We demonstrate our algorithm on two toy models and on a small simulated LISA dataset of Galactic binaries. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python package petra_catalogs, and it can be applied in postprocessing to the output of any global-fit sampler.
