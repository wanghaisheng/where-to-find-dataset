## abstracts:
We embed several copies of the derived category of a quiver and certain line bundles in the derived category of an associated moduli space of representations, giving the start of a semiorthogonal decomposition. This mirrors the semiorthogonal decompositions of moduli of vector bundles on curves. Our results are obtained with QuiverTools, an open-source package of tools for quiver representations, their moduli spaces and their geometrical properties.
## QA:
coming soon
