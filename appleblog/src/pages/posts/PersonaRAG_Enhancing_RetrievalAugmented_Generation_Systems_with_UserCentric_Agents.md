## abstracts:
Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with generating reliable outputs due to outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models address this by enhancing LLMs with external knowledge, but often fail to personalize the retrieval process. This paper introduces PersonaRAG, a novel framework incorporating user-centric agents to adapt retrieval and generation based on real-time user data and interactions. Evaluated across various question answering datasets, PersonaRAG demonstrates superiority over baseline models, providing tailored answers to user needs. The results suggest promising directions for user-adapted information retrieval systems.
