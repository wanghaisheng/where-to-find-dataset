## abstracts:
Cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease with significant variability in molecular features and clinical outcomes, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. In recent years, high-throughput omic technologies have facilitated the discovery of mechanisms underlying various cancer subtypes by providing diverse omics data, such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of multi-omics data present significant challenges for their integration in exploring cancer subtypes. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel and straightforward approach for identifying cancer subtypes by integrating patient-specific subnetworks features from different omics data. We construct patient-specific induced subnetwork using a random walk with restart algorithm from patient similarity networks (PSNs) and compute nine structural properties that capture essential network topology. These features are integrated across the three omic datasets to form comprehensive patient profiles. K-means clustering is then applied for cancer subtype identification. We evaluate our approach on five cancer datasets, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma, for three different omic data types. The evaluation shows that our method produces promising and effective results, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods and underscoring its potential for advancing personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment.
