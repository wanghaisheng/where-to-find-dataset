## abstracts:
Facial-video based Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims at measuring physiological signals and monitoring heart activity without any contact, showing significant potential in various applications. Previous deep learning based rPPG measurement are primarily based on CNNs and Transformers. However, the limited receptive fields of CNNs restrict their ability to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies, while Transformers also struggle with modeling long video sequences with high complexity. Recently, the state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba are known for their impressive performance on capturing long-range dependencies from long sequences. In this paper, we propose the PhysMamba, a Mamba-based framework, to efficiently represent long-range physiological dependencies from facial videos. Specifically, we introduce the Temporal Difference Mamba block to first enhance local dynamic differences and further model the long-range spatio-temporal context. Moreover, a dual-stream SlowFast architecture is utilized to fuse the multi-scale temporal features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of PhysMamba. The codes are available at https://github.com/Chaoqi31/PhysMamba
