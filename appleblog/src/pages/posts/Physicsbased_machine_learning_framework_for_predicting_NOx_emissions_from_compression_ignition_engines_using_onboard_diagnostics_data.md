## abstracts:
This work presents a physics-based machine learning framework to predict and analyze oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from compression-ignition engine-powered vehicles using on-board diagnostics (OBD) data as input. Accurate NOx prediction from OBD datasets is difficult because NOx formation inside an engine combustion chamber is governed by complex processes occurring on timescales much shorter than the data collection rate. Thus, emissions generally cannot be predicted accurately using simple empirically derived physics models. Black box models like genetic algorithms or neural networks can be more accurate, but have poor interpretability. The transparent model presented in this paper has both high accuracy and can explain potential sources of high emissions. The proposed framework consists of two major steps: a physics-based NOx prediction model combined with a novel Divergent Window Co-occurrence (DWC) Pattern detection algorithm to analyze operating conditions that are not adequately addressed by the physics-based model. The proposed framework is validated for generalizability with a second vehicle OBD dataset, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and model predictions are compared with that from a deep neural network. The results show that NOx emissions predictions using the proposed model has around 55% better root mean square error, and around 60% higher mean absolute error compared to the baseline NOx prediction model from previously published work. The DWC Pattern Detection Algorithm identified low engine power conditions to have high statistical significance, indicating an operating regime where the model can be improved. This work shows that the physics-based machine learning framework is a viable method for predicting NOx emissions from engines that do not incorporate NOx sensing.
