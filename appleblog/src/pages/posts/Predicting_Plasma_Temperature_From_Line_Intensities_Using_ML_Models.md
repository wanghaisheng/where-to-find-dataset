## abstracts:
In this work, ML models were used to predict the plasma temperature using the dataset obtained by implementing the CR-model for Na-like Krypton. The models included in the study are: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network. For evaluating the models we used Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score as metrics, In our study Random Forest performed best as compared to other model considered, the study conclude that complex relation between the line-intensities and Plasma temperature can be capture by ML models and they can be used to predict the temperature with high accuracy.
## QA:
coming soon
