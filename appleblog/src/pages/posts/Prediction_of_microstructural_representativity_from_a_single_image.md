## abstracts:
In this study, we present a method for predicting the representativity of the phase fraction observed in a single image (2D or 3D) of a material. Traditional approaches often require large datasets and extensive statistical analysis to estimate the Integral Range, a key factor in determining the variance of microstructural properties. Our method leverages the Two-Point Correlation function to directly estimate the variance from a single image (2D or 3D), thereby enabling phase fraction prediction with associated confidence levels. We validate our approach using open-source datasets, demonstrating its efficacy across diverse microstructures. This technique significantly reduces the data requirements for representativity analysis, providing a practical tool for material scientists and engineers working with limited microstructural data. To make the method easily accessible, we have created a web-application, \url{www.imagerep.io}, for quick, simple and informative use of the method.
