## abstracts:
This work introduces a new framework, ProtoSAM, for one-shot medical image segmentation. It combines the use of prototypical networks, known for few-shot segmentation, with SAM - a natural image foundation model. The method proposed creates an initial coarse segmentation mask using the ALPnet prototypical network, augmented with a DINOv2 encoder. Following the extraction of an initial mask, prompts are extracted, such as points and bounding boxes, which are then input into the Segment Anything Model (SAM). State-of-the-art results are shown on several medical image datasets and demonstrate automated segmentation capabilities using a single image example (one shot) with no need for fine-tuning of the foundation model.
## QA:
coming soon
