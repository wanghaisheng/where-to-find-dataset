## abstracts:
Label-free quantitative phase imaging is a vital tool for optical microscopy and metrology applications. A hair-thin multimode fiber stands out as a very attractive platform for minimally invasive imaging. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a non-interferometric non-iterative approach for high-speed high-resolution label-free quantitative phase imaging via a multimode fiber, unlocking multiple applications in life science and bioimaging.
## QA:
coming soon
