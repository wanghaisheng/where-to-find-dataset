## abstracts:
Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.
