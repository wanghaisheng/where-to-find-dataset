## abstracts:
Scene observation from multiple perspectives would bring a more comprehensive visual experience. However, in the context of acquiring multiple views in the dark, the highly correlated views are seriously alienated, making it challenging to improve scene understanding with auxiliary views. Recent single image-based enhancement methods may not be able to provide consistently desirable restoration performance for all views due to the ignorance of potential feature correspondence among different views. To alleviate this issue, we make the first attempt to investigate multi-view low-light image enhancement. First, we construct a new dataset called Multi-View Low-light Triplets (MVLT), including 1,860 pairs of triple images with large illumination ranges and wide noise distribution. Each triplet is equipped with three different viewpoints towards the same scene. Second, we propose a deep multi-view enhancement framework based on the Recurrent Collaborative Network (RCNet). Specifically, in order to benefit from similar texture correspondence across different views, we design the recurrent feature enhancement, alignment and fusion (ReEAF) module, in which intra-view feature enhancement (Intra-view EN) followed by inter-view feature alignment and fusion (Inter-view AF) is performed to model the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation sequentially via multi-view collaboration. In addition, two different modules from enhancement to alignment (E2A) and from alignment to enhancement (A2E) are developed to enable the interactions between Intra-view EN and Inter-view AF, which explicitly utilize attentive feature weighting and sampling for enhancement and alignment, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our RCNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. All of our dataset, code, and model will be available at https://github.com/hluo29/RCNet.
