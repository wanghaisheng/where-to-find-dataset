## abstracts:
This paper addresses the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a novel, data-driven approach that leverages state-of-the-art AI models. Traditionally, interference rejection algorithms are manually tailored to specific types of interference. This work introduces a more scalable data-driven solution and contains the following contributions. First, we present an insightful signal model that serves as a foundation for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. Second, we introduce the RF Challenge, a publicly available dataset featuring diverse RF signals along with code templates, which facilitates data-driven analysis of RF signal problems. Third, we propose novel AI-based rejection algorithms, specifically architectures like UNet and WaveNet, and evaluate their performance across eight different signal mixture types. These models demonstrate superior performance exceeding traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation by up to two orders of magnitude in bit-error rate. Fourth, we summarize the results from an open competition hosted at 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024) based on the RF Challenge, highlighting the significant potential for continued advancements in this area. Our findings underscore the promise of deep learning algorithms in mitigating interference, offering a strong foundation for future research.
