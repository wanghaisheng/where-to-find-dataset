## abstracts:
Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide secure key material between two parties without relying on assumptions about the computational power of an eavesdropper. QKD is performed over quantum links and quantum networks, systems which are resource-intensive to deploy and maintain. To evaluate and optimize performance prior to, during, and after deployment, realistic simulations with attention to physical realism are necessary. Quantum network simulators can simulate a variety of quantum and classical protocols and can assist in quantum network design and optimization by offering realism and flexibility beyond mathematical models which rely on simplifying assumptions and can be intractable to solve as network complexity increases. We use a versatile discrete event quantum network simulator to simulate the entanglement-based QKD protocol BBM92 and compare it to our experimental implementation and to existing theory. Furthermore, we simulate secure key rates in a repeater key distribution scenario for which no experimental implementations exist.
## QA:
coming soon
