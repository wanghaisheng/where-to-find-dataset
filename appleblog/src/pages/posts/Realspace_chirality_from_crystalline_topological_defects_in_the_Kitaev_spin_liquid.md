## abstracts:
We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By defining and computing multiple formulations of local Chern markers we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects host a contribution to real-space chirality, which we dub "Chern charge" or $\mathcal{Q_M}$. The sign of this local Chern charge obeys $\text{sgn}({\mathcal{Q_M}}) = - i ~ \text{sgn}(F) W$ where $F$ is the disclination Frank angle and $W = \pm i$ is its emergent-gauge-field flux. We show that lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the $\mathcal{Q_M}$ profile and magnitude, but that the sign of $\mathcal{Q_M}$ is set by local properties of the defect, enabling the identification of Chern charges.
