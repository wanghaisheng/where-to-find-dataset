## abstracts:
Machine unlearning seeks to systematically remove specified data from a trained model, effectively achieving a state as though the data had never been encountered during training. While metrics such as Unlearning Accuracy (UA) and Membership Inference Attack (MIA) provide a baseline for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the completeness and reliability of forgetting. This is because the ground truth labels remain potential candidates within the scope of uncertainty quantification, leaving gaps in the evaluation of true forgetting. In this paper, we identify critical limitations in existing unlearning metrics and propose enhanced evaluation metrics inspired by conformal prediction. Our metrics can effectively capture the extent to which ground truth labels are excluded from the prediction set. Furthermore, we observe that many existing machine unlearning methods do not achieve satisfactory forgetting performance when evaluated with our new metrics. To address this, we propose an unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction insights into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate that our enhanced metrics offer deeper insights into unlearning effectiveness, and that our unlearning framework significantly improves the forgetting quality of unlearning methods.
