## abstracts:
Since classical machine learning has become a powerful tool for developing data-driven algorithms, quantum machine learning is expected to similarly impact the development of quantum algorithms. The literature reflects a mutually beneficial relationship between machine learning and quantum computing, where progress in one field frequently drives improvements in the other. Motivated by the fertile connection between machine learning and quantum computing enabled by parameterized quantum circuits, we use a resource-efficient and scalable Single-Qubit Quantum Neural Network (SQQNN) for both regression and classification tasks. The SQQNN leverages parameterized single-qubit unitary operators and quantum measurements to achieve efficient learning. To train the model, we use gradient descent for regression tasks. For classification, we introduce a novel training method inspired by the Taylor series, which can efficiently find a global minimum in a single step. This approach significantly accelerates training compared to iterative methods. Evaluated across various applications, the SQQNN exhibits virtually error-free and strong performance in regression and classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. These results demonstrate the versatility, scalability, and suitability of the SQQNN for deployment on near-term quantum devices.
