## abstracts:
Sound event localization and detection (SELD) involves predicting active sound event classes over time while estimating their positions. The localization subtask in SELD is usually treated as a direction of arrival estimation problem, ignoring source distance. Only recently, SELD was extended to 3D by incorporating distance estimation, enabling the prediction of sound event positions in 3D space (3D SELD). However, existing methods lack input features designed for distance estimation. We argue that reverberation encodes valuable information for this task. This paper introduces two novel feature formats for 3D SELD based on reverberation: one using direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR) and another leveraging signal autocorrelation to provide the model with insights into early reflections. Pre-training on synthetic data improves relative distance error (RDE) and overall SELD score, with autocorrelation-based features reducing RDE by over 3 percentage points on the STARSS23 dataset. The code to extract the features is available at github.com/dberghi/SELD-distance-features.
