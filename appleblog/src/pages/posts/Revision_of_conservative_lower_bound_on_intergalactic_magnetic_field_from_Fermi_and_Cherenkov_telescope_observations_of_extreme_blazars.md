## abstracts:
Joint observations of extreme blazars with Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT) have been previously used to derive lower bounds on intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We update these previous bounds using a set of extreme blazars that are detected in the Very-High-Energy (VHE, photon energies above 100 GeV) band by both Fermi/LAT and IACTs. We measure IGMF-dependent suppression of secondary delayed gamma-ray flux from electron-positron pairs deposited in the intergalactic medium by VHE gamma-rays interacting with Extragalactic Background Light. From overall 22 extreme blazars detected by Fermi/LAT and IACTs in the VHE band, seven have their spectral characteristics inconsistent with the possibility of zero magnetic field along their lines of sight, even under the most restrictive assumption that the sources have only switched on at the start of VHE band observations. Adopting this assumption, we derive a "conservative" lower bound on the IGMF strength at the level of 2e-17 G. The tightest bound is imposed by the signal of 1ES 0502+675, a source that has not been considered in the IGMF analysis before. Our bound is comparable to the bound derived by MAGIC collaboration, but is weaker than that previously derived from analysis of Fermi/LAT and HESS telescope data, even though our dataset includes that data. We clarify the origin of this discrepancy.
