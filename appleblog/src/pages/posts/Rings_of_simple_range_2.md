## abstracts:
We introduce the concept of rings of simple range 2. Based on this concept, we build a theory diagonal reduction of matrices over Bezout domain. In particular we show that invariant Bezout domain is an elementary divisor ring if and only if it is a rings of simple range 2.
## QA:
coming soon
