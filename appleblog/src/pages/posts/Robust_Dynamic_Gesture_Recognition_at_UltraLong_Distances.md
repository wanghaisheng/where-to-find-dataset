## abstracts:
Dynamic hand gestures play a crucial role in conveying nonverbal information for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), eliminating the need for complex interfaces. Current models for dynamic gesture recognition suffer from limitations in effective recognition range, restricting their application to close proximity scenarios. In this letter, we present a novel approach to recognizing dynamic gestures in an ultra-range distance of up to 28 meters, enabling natural, directive communication for guiding robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our proposed SlowFast-Transformer (SFT) model effectively integrates the SlowFast architecture with Transformer layers to efficiently process and classify gesture sequences captured at ultra-range distances, overcoming challenges of low resolution and environmental noise. We further introduce a distance-weighted loss function shown to enhance learning and improve model robustness at varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.1% on a diverse dataset with challenging ultra-range gestures. This enables robots to react appropriately to human commands from a far distance, providing an essential enhancement in HRI, especially in scenarios requiring seamless and natural interaction.
