## abstracts:
Language Models (LMs) are increasingly employed in recommendation systems due to their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recent recommender systems based on generative retrieval have leveraged the inferential abilities of LMs to directly generate the index tokens of the next item, based on item sequences within the user's interaction history. Previous studies have mostly focused on item indices based solely on textual semantic or collaborative information. However, although the standalone effectiveness of these aspects has been demonstrated, the integration of this information has remained unexplored. Our in-depth analysis finds that there is a significant difference in the knowledge captured by the model from heterogeneous item indices and diverse input prompts, which can have a high potential for complementarity. In this paper, we propose SC-Rec, a unified recommender system that learns diverse preference knowledge from two distinct item indices and multiple prompt templates. Furthermore, SC-Rec adopts a novel reranking strategy that aggregates a set of ranking results, inferred based on different indices and prompts, to achieve the self-consistency of the model. Our empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that SC-Rec considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation, effectively incorporating complementary knowledge from varied outputs of the model.
