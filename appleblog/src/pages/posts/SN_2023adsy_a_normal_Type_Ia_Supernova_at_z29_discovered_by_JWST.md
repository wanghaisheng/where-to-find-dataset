## abstracts:
SN 2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z = 2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we show that the red color and faint peak magnitude could be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust in the host galaxy. If host galaxy extinction is accounted for, the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates in the SALT3-NIR model are compatible with a slowly declining, but still normal SN Ia. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the LambdaCDM cosmology (assuming H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and OmegaM = 0.315) on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z > 2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 < z < 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.
