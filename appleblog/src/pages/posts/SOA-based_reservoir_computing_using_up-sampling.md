## abstracts:
We introduce a new approach to reservoir computing based on up-sampling and modulation, utilizing semiconductor optical amplifier and photodetector as nonlinear elements without conventionally used delay loop. We demonstrated the 400-step prediction capability of the proposed scheme for the Mackey-Glass time series test.
## QA:
coming soon
