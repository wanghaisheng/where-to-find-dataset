## abstracts:
Central bank communication plays a critical role in shaping economic expectations and monetary policy effectiveness. This study applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of press releases from the Bank of Thailand, addressing gaps in research that primarily focus on lexicon-based approaches. My findings show that supervised learning can be an effective method, even with smaller datasets, and serves as a starting point for further automation. However, achieving higher accuracy and better generalization requires a substantial amount of labeled data, which is time-consuming and demands expertise. Using models such as Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM, this study demonstrates the applicability of machine learning for central bank sentiment analysis, with English-language communications from the Thai Central Bank as a case study.
