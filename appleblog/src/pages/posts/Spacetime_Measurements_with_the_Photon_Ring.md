## abstracts:
We explore the universal symmetries of the black hole photon ring in a wide range of non-Kerr spacetimes, including the Kerr-Newman, Kerr-Sen, Kerr-Bardeen, and Kerr-Hayward metrics. The demagnification exponent ($\gamma$) controls the size and flux scaling of higher-order images, which appear in the photon ring, the delay time ($\tau$) determines the timing of their appearance, and the rotation parameter ($\delta$) relates their relative orientations on the image plane. Our investigation reveals distinct responses of these critical parameters to black hole spin, generalized charge, and observer inclination: $\gamma$ is predominantly influenced by charge and spin, $\tau$ is strongly affected by inclination, especially for near-extremal black holes, and $\delta$ is highly sensitive to spin. Notably, we find that the time delay provides an independent constraint on shadow size for polar observers, while the rotation parameter facilitates metric-independent spin measurements. Specifically, for Kerr black holes, the total variation in $\gamma$, $\tau$, and $\delta$ across all possible inclinations is $\lesssim 10\%$, $\lesssim 20\%$, and $\lesssim 60\%$, respectively. In contrast, the Kerr shadow size varies by only $\lesssim 8\%$.
