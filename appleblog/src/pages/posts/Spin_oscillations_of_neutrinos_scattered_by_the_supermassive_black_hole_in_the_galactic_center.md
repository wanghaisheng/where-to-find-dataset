## abstracts:
In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk which can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH. Moreover, we assume that a disk contains only a toroidal magnetic magnetic field of moderate strength. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.
