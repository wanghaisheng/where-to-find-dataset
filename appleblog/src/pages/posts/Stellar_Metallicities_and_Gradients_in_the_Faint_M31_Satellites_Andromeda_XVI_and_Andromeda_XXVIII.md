## abstracts:
We present $\sim300$ stellar metallicity measurements in two faint M31 dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XVI ($M_V = -7.5$) and Andromeda XXVIII ($M_V = -8.8$) derived using metallicity-sensitive Calcium H & K narrow-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These are the first individual stellar metallicities in And~XVI (95 stars). Our And~XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of $\sim15$ increase over literature metallicities. For And~XVI, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.17^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.23\pm0.15$ dex $R_e^{-1}$. We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than MW UFDs of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -1.95^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.34^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.46 \pm 0.10$~dex~$R_e^{-1}$, placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function with an abrupt metal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The stellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint ($L \lesssim 10^6~L_{\odot}$) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies' gradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an age-gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar feedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal poor ($\mbox{[Fe/H]} < -3.0$) star candidates, which make up 7% of And~XVI's MDF and 6% of And~XXVIII's.
