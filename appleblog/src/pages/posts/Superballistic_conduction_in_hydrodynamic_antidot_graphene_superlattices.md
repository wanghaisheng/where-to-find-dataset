## abstracts:
Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. Bending the geometry of the device is a must to observe hydrodynamic effects. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field, which is related with the ballistic-hydrodynamic transition. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow, and the experiment provides valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.
