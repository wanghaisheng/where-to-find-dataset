## abstracts:
Recently, the notion of symmetry descent has been introduced in order to obtain the $(d+1)$-dimensional Symmetry TFT (SymTFT) of a $d$-dimensional QFT from the edge mode behaviour of a theory in $(d+2)$-dimensions. This method has so far been used to obtain SymTFTs for discrete higher-form symmetries of geometrically engineered QFTs. In this note, we extend the symmetry descent procedure to obtain SymTFTs for $U(1)$ higher-form symmetries of geometrically engineered QFTs. We find the resulting SymTFTs match those in the works of Antinucci-Benini and Brennan-Sun.
## QA:
coming soon
