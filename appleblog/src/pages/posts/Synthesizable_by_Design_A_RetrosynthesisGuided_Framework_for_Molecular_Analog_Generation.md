## abstracts:
The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.
