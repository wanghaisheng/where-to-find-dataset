## abstracts:
We introduce the Bayesian Global Sky Model (B-GSM), a novel data-driven Bayesian approach to modelling radio foregrounds at frequencies <400~MHz. B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors. This is the first of two papers, and is focused on validation of B-GSMs Bayesian framework, the second paper will present results of deployment on real data and introduce the low-frequency sky model which will be available for public download.
