## abstracts:
In the first paper of this sequence, we provided an explicit hypergeometric modularity method by combining different techniques from the classical, $p$-adic, and finite field settings. In this article, we explore an application of this method from a motivic viewpoint through some known hypergeometric well-poised formulae of Whipple and McCarthy. We first use the method to derive a class of special weight three modular forms, labeled as $\mathbb{K}_2$-functions. Then using well-poised hypergeometric formulae we further construct a class of degree four Galois representations of the absolute Galois groups of the corresponding cyclotomic fields. These representations are then shown to be extendable to $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$ and the $L$-function of each extension coincides with the $L$-function of an automorphic form.
