## abstracts:
Inspired by a chessboard puzzle of Dudeney, the general position problem in graph theory asks for the largest sets $S$ of vertices in a graph such that no three elements of $S$ lie on a common shortest path. The number of vertices in such a largest set is the general position number of the graph. This paper provides a survey of this rapidly growing problem, which now has an extensive literature. We cover exact results for various graph classes and the behaviour of the general position number under various graph products and operations. We also discuss interesting variations of the general position problem, for example variants corresponding to different graph convexities, as well as dynamic, fractional, colouring and game versions of the problem.
