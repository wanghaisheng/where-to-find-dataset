## abstracts:
We present the Julia package SagbiHomotopy.jl for solving systems of polynomial equations using numerical homotopy continuation. The package introduces an optimal choice of a start system based on SAGBI homotopies. For square horizontally parameterized systems, where each equation is a linear combination of a given set of polynomials, SAGBI homotopies significantly reduce the number of solution paths to track compared to polyhedral homotopies currently used by default in most software for numerical homotopy continuation. We illustrate our framework with a variety of examples, including problems arising in chemistry and physics.
## QA:
coming soon
