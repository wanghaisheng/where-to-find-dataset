## abstracts:
The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project aims to develop a constellation of two CubeSats orbiting the Earth to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter on board of each satellite. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures. CUSP is a project approved for a Phase B study by the Italian Space Agency in the framework of the Alcor program aimed to develop CubeSat technologies and missions. In this paper we describe the a method for a multi-physical simulation analysis while analyzing some possible design optimization of the payload design solutions adopted. In particular, we report the mechanical design for each structural component, the results of static and dynamic finite element analysis, the preliminary thermo-mechanical analysis for two specific thermal cases (hot and cold orbit) and a topological optimization of the interface between the platform and the payload.
