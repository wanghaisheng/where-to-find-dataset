## abstracts:
We present several illustrations from completed clinical trials on a statistical approach that allows us to gain useful insights regarding the time dependency of treatment effects. Our approach leans on a simple proposition: all non-proportional hazards (NPH) models are equivalent to a proportional hazards model. The nph2ph transform brings an NPH model into a PH form. We often find very simple approximations for this transform, enabling us to analyze complex NPH observations as though they had arisen under proportional hazards. Many techniques become available to us, and we use these to understand treatment effects better.
## QA:
coming soon
