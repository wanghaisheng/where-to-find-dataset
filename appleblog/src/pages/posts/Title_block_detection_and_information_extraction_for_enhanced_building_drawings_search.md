## abstracts:
The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry still heavily relies on information stored in drawings for building construction, maintenance, compliance and error checks. However, information extraction (IE) from building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when dealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by leveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing, which can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex especially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing standards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods for this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and IE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with complex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference pipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then extract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used for drawing search, filtering and grouping. The work demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in IE for both vector (CAD) and hand-drawn (historical) drawings. A user interface (UI) that leverages the extracted metadata for drawing search is established and deployed on real projects, which demonstrates significant time savings. Additionally, an extensible domain-expert-annotated dataset for title block detection is developed, via an efficient AEC-friendly annotation workflow that lays the foundation for future work.
