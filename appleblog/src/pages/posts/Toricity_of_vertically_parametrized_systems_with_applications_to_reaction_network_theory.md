## abstracts:
In this paper, we present new necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the (positive parts of) the varieties of vertically parametrized systems to admit monomial parametrizations. The conditions are based on a combination of polyhedral geometry and previously known results about injectivity of monomial maps. The motivation arises from the study of steady state varieties of reaction networks, as toricity simplifies the determination of multistationarity substantially.
