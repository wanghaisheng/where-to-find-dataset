## abstracts:
3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) has emerged as a prominent research topic, particularly in the realm of RGB-based methods. However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.
