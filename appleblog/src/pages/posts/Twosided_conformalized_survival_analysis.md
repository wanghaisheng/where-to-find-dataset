## abstracts:
This paper presents a novel method using conformal prediction to generate two-sided or one-sided prediction intervals for survival times. Specifically, the method provides both lower and upper predictive bounds for individuals deemed sufficiently similar to the non-censored population, while returning only a lower bound for others. The prediction intervals offer finite-sample coverage guarantees, requiring no distributional assumptions other than the sampled data points are independent and identically distributed. The performance of the procedure is assessed using both synthetic and real-world datasets.
## QA:
coming soon
