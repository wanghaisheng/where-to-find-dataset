## abstracts:
We show that ultrafast optical pump pulses provide effective control over charge orders in the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ with $A=$ K, Rb, and Cs. Starting from the real charge density waves (rCDWs) at the $p$-type Van Hove singularity, we conduct a thorough analysis of the post-pump dynamics by time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical phenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized pumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an enhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and receives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand with a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized pumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with charge loop currents. Our results can be directly compared to the pump-probe experiments on the kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.
