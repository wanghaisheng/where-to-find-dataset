## abstracts:
The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.
