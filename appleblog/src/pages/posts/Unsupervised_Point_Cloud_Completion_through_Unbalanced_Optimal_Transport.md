## abstracts:
Unpaired point cloud completion explores methods for learning a completion map from unpaired incomplete and complete point cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unpaired point cloud completion using the unbalanced optimal transport map, called Unbalanced Optimal Transport Map for Unpaired Point Cloud Completion (UOT-UPC). We demonstrate that the unpaired point cloud completion can be naturally interpreted as the Optimal Transport (OT) problem and introduce the Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) approach to address the class imbalance problem, which is prevalent in unpaired point cloud completion datasets. Moreover, we analyze the appropriate cost function for unpaired completion tasks. This analysis shows that the InfoCD cost function is particularly well-suited for this task. Our model is the first attempt to leverage UOT for unpaired point cloud completion, achieving competitive or superior results on both single-category and multi-category datasets. In particular, our model is especially effective in scenarios with class imbalance, where the proportions of categories are different between the incomplete and complete point cloud datasets.
