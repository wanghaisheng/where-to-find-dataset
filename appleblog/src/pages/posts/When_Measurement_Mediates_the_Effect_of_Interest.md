## abstracts:
Many health promotion strategies aim to improve reach into the target population and outcomes among those reached. For example, an HIV prevention strategy could expand the reach of risk screening and the delivery of biomedical prevention to persons with HIV risk. This setting creates a complex missing data problem: the strategy improves health outcomes directly and indirectly through expanded reach, while outcomes are only measured among those reached. To formally define the total causal effect in such settings, we use Counterfactual Strata Effects: causal estimands where the outcome is only relevant for a group whose membership is subject to missingness and/or impacted by the exposure. To identify and estimate the corresponding statistical estimand, we propose a novel extension of Two-Stage targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE). Simulations demonstrate the practical performance of our approach as well as the limitations of existing approaches.
