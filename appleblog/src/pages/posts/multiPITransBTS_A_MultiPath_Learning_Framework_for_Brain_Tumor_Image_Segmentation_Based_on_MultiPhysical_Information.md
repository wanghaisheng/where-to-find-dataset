## abstracts:
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of brain tumors. However, due to the variability in tumor appearance, size, and intensity across different MRI modalities, automated segmentation remains a challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework, multiPI-TransBTS, which integrates multi-physical information to enhance segmentation accuracy. The model leverages spatial information, semantic information, and multi-modal imaging data, addressing the inherent heterogeneity in brain tumor characteristics. The multiPI-TransBTS framework consists of an encoder, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) module, and a multi-source, multi-scale feature decoder. The encoder incorporates a multi-branch architecture to separately extract modality-specific features from different MRI sequences. The AFF module fuses information from multiple sources using channel-wise and element-wise attention, ensuring effective feature recalibration. The decoder combines both common and task-specific features through a Task-Specific Feature Introduction (TSFI) strategy, producing accurate segmentation outputs for Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET) regions. Comprehensive evaluations on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of multiPI-TransBTS over the state-of-the-art methods. The model consistently achieves better Dice coefficients, Hausdorff distances, and Sensitivity scores, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the BraTS challenges. Our results also indicate the need for further exploration of the balance between precision and recall in the ET segmentation task. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in BraTS, with potential implications for improving clinical outcomes for brain tumor patients.
