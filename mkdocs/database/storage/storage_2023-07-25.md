|**2023-07-24**|**Multipoint fishnet Feynman diagrams: sequential splitting**|Francesco Aprile et.al.|[2307.12984v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12984v1)|null|We study fishnet Feynman diagrams defined by a certain triangulation of a planar n-gon, with massless scalars propagating along and across the cuts. Our solution theory uses the technique of Separation of Variables, in combination with the theory of symmetric polynomials and Mellin space. The n-point split-ladders are solved by a recursion where all building blocks are made fully explicit. In particular, we find an elegant formula for the coefficient functions of the light-cone leading logs. When the diagram grows into a fishnet, we obtain new results exploiting a Cauchy identity decomposition of the measure over separated variables. This leads to an elementary proof of the Basso-Dixon formula at 4-points, while at n-points it provides a natural OPE-like stratification of the diagram. Finally, we propose an independent approach based on ``stampede" combinatorics to study the light-cone behaviour of the diagrams as the partition function of a certain vertex model.|

Moreover, human sketch understanding goes beyond categorization -- critically, it also entails understanding how individual elements within a sketch correspond to parts of the physical world it represents. What are the computational ingredients needed to support this ability? Towards answering this question, we make two contributions: first, we introduce a new sketch-photo correspondence benchmark, $\textit{PSC6k}$, containing 150K annotations of 6250 sketch-photo pairs across 125 object categories, augmenting the existing Sketchy dataset with fine-grained correspondence metadata. Second, we propose a self-supervised method for learning dense correspondences between sketch-photo pairs, building upon recent advances in correspondence learning for pairs of photos. Our model uses a spatial transformer network to estimate the warp flow between latent representations of a sketch and photo extracted by a contrastive learning-based ConvNet backbone. We found that this approach outperformed several strong baselines and produced predictions that were quantitatively consistent with other warp-based methods. However, our benchmark also revealed systematic differences between predictions of the suite of models we tested and those of humans. Taken together, our work suggests a promising path towards developing artificial systems that achieve more human-like understanding of visual images at different levels of abstraction.

|**2023-07-24**|**GridMM: Grid Memory Map for Vision-and-Language Navigation**|Zihan Wang et.al.|[2307.12907v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12907v1)|[link](https://github.com/mrzihan/gridmm)|Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a remote location following the natural language instruction in 3D environments. To represent the previously visited environment, most approaches for VLN implement memory using recurrent states, topological maps, or top-down semantic maps. In contrast to these approaches, we build the top-down egocentric and dynamically growing Grid Memory Map (i.e., GridMM) to structure the visited environment. From a global perspective, historical observations are projected into a unified grid map in a top-down view, which can better represent the spatial relations of the environment. From a local perspective, we further propose an instruction relevance aggregation method to capture fine-grained visual clues in each grid region. Extensive experiments are conducted on both the REVERIE, R2R, SOON datasets in the discrete environments, and the R2R-CE dataset in the continuous environments, showing the superiority of our proposed method.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Monodromy kernels for strata of translation surfaces**|Riccardo Giannini et.al.|[2307.12901v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12901v1)|null|The non-hyperelliptic connected components of the strata of translation surfaces are conjectured to be orbifold classifying spaces for some groups commensurable to some mapping class groups. The topological monodromy map of the non-hyperelliptic components projects naturally to the mapping class group of the underlying punctured surface and is an obvious candidate to test commensurability. In the present article, we prove that for the components $\mathcal{H}(3,1)$ and $\mathcal{H}^{nh}(4)$ in genus 3 the monodromy map fails to demonstrate the conjectured commensurability. In particular, building on work of Wajnryb, we prove that the kernels of the monodromy maps for $\mathcal{H}(3,1)$ and $\mathcal{H}^{nh}(4)$ are large, as they contain a non-abelian free group of rank $2$|

Cryptocurrency wallets, serving as crucial endpoints for these transactions, have become increasingly prevalent. However, the escalating value and usage of these wallets also expose them to significant security risks and challenges. This research aims to comprehensively explore the security aspects of cryptocurrency wallets. It provides a taxonomy of wallet types, analyzes their design and implementation, identifies common vulnerabilities and attacks, and discusses defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies. The taxonomy covers custodial, non-custodial, hot, and cold wallets, highlighting their unique characteristics and associated security considerations. The security analysis scrutinizes the theoretical and practical aspects of wallet design, while assessing the efficacy of existing security measures and protocols. Notable wallet attacks, such as Binance, Mt. Gox are examined to understand their causes and consequences. Furthermore, the paper surveys defense mechanisms, transaction monitoring, evaluating their effectiveness in mitigating threats.|
|**2023-07-24**|**A quantitative theoretical model of the boson peak based on stringlet excitations**|Cunyuan Jiang et.al.|[2307.12839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12839v1)|null|The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the phonon Debye contribution, is usually identified as one of the distinguishing features between ordered crystals and amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery and a consensus on its theoretical derivation has not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes which involve string-like excitations ("stringlets") having a one-dimensional (1D) nature. In this work, we build on a theoretical framework originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in independent simulation studies. We show that a generalization of this framework provides an analytically prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the glass transition temperature in both 2D and 3D amorphous systems. The final result involves no free parameters and is in quantitative agreement with prior simulation observations. Additionally, this stringlet theory of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in cooled liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes at finite temperature which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, as observed in both experiments and simulations.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Exposing the Troublemakers in Described Object Detection**|Chi Xie et.al.|[2307.12813v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12813v1)|[link](https://github.com/shikras/d-cube)|Detecting objects based on language descriptions is a popular task that includes Open-Vocabulary object Detection (OVD) and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). In this paper, we advance them to a more practical setting called Described Object Detection (DOD) by expanding category names to flexible language expressions for OVD and overcoming the limitation of REC to only grounding the pre-existing object. We establish the research foundation for DOD tasks by constructing a Description Detection Dataset ($D^3$), featuring flexible language expressions and annotating all described objects without omission. By evaluating previous SOTA methods on $D^3$, we find some troublemakers that fail current REC, OVD, and bi-functional methods. REC methods struggle with confidence scores, rejecting negative instances, and multi-target scenarios, while OVD methods face constraints with long and complex descriptions. Recent bi-functional methods also do not work well on DOD due to their separated training procedures and inference strategies for REC and OVD tasks. Building upon the aforementioned findings, we propose a baseline that largely improves REC methods by reconstructing the training data and introducing a binary classification sub-task, outperforming existing methods. Data and code is available at https://github.com/shikras/d-cube.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Imperfect CSI: A Key Factor of Uncertainty to Over-the-Air Federated Learning**|Jiacheng Yao et.al.|[2307.12793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12793v1)|null|Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently been identified as a prominent technique to enhance communication efficiency of wireless federated learning (FL). This letter investigates the impact of channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the transmitter on an AirComp enabled FL (AirFL) system with the truncated channel inversion strategy. To characterize the performance of the AirFL system, the weight divergence with respect to the ideal aggregation is analytically derived to evaluate learning performance loss. We explicitly reveal that the weight divergence deteriorates as $\mathcal{O}(1/\rho^2)$ as the level of channel estimation accuracy $\rho$ vanishes, and also has a decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K^2)$ with the increasing number of participating devices, $K$. Building upon our analytical results, we formulate the channel truncation threshold optimization problem to adapt to different $\rho$, which can be solved optimally. Numerical results verify the analytical results and show that a lower truncation threshold is preferred with more accurate CSI.|

This performance is attributed to the coupling effect of Ag-O-Ni sites to enhance the hydrogenation of CO2 and weaken the CO adsorption, resulting in 1434 mmol g-1 h-1 of CO yield at 300 degree, surpassing any low-temperature RWGS performances ever reported. Building on this, we integrated the 2D Ni1Ag0.02O1 supported photothermal RWGS with commercial photovoltaic electrolytic water splitting, leading to the realization of 103 m2 scale artificial photosynthesis system with a daily CO yield of 18.70 m3, a photochemical energy conversion efficiency of >16%, over 90% H2 ultilazation efficiency, outperforming other types of artificial photosynthesis. The results of this research chart a promising course for designing practical, natural sunlight-driven artificial photosynthesis systems and highly efficient platinum-free CO2 hydrogenation catalysts. This work is a significant step towards harnessing solar energy more efficiently and sustainably, opening exciting possibilities for future research and development in this area.|
|**2023-07-24**|**First look at data from the 13-antenna setup of GRANDProto300 in northwest China**|Peng-Xiong Ma et.al.|[2307.12769v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12769v1)|null|The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays, with energies above 100 PeV. GRAND targets the radio signals emitted by extensive air showers induced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere, using an array of 200,000 radio antennas split into sub-arrays deployed worldwide. GRANDProto13 (GP13) is a 13-antenna demonstrator array deployed in February 2023 in the Gansu province of China, as a precursor for GRANDProto300, which will validate the detection principle of the GRAND experiment. Its goal is to measure the radio background present at the site, validate the design of the detection units and develop an autonomous radio trigger for air showers. We will describe GP13 and its operation, and show preliminary results on noise monitoring.|

An effective Automated Speech Recognition system can accurately transcribe these calls for easy search through call history for specific context and content allowing automatic call monitoring, improving QoS through keyword search and sentiment analysis. ASR for Call Center requires more robustness as telephonic environment are generally noisy. Moreover, there are many low-resourced languages that are on verge of extinction which can be preserved with help of Automatic Speech Recognition Technology. Urdu is the $10^{th}$ most widely spoken language in the world, with 231,295,440 worldwide still remains a resource constrained language in ASR. Regional call-center conversations operate in local language, with a mix of English numbers and technical terms generally causing a "code-switching" problem. Hence, this paper describes an implementation framework of a resource efficient Automatic Speech Recognition/ Speech to Text System in a noisy call-center environment using Chain Hybrid HMM and CNN-TDNN for Code-Switched Urdu Language. Using Hybrid HMM-DNN approach allowed us to utilize the advantages of Neural Network with less labelled data. Adding CNN with TDNN has shown to work better in noisy environment due to CNN's additional frequency dimension which captures extra information from noisy speech, thus improving accuracy. We collected data from various open sources and labelled some of the unlabelled data after analysing its general context and content from Urdu language as well as from commonly used words from other languages, primarily English and were able to achieve WER of 5.2% with noisy as well as clean environment in isolated words or numbers as well as in continuous spontaneous speech.|
|**2023-07-24**|**The ro-vibrational $ν_2$ mode spectrum of methane investigated by ultrabroadband coherent Raman spectroscopy**|Francesco Mazza et.al.|[2307.12740v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12740v1)|null|We present the first experimental application of coherent Raman spectroscopy (CRS) on the ro-vibrational $\nu_2$ mode spectrum of methane (CH$_4$). Ultrabroadband femtosecond/picosecond (fs/ps) CRS is performed in the molecular fingerprint region from 1100 to 2000 cm$^{-1}$, employing fs laser-induced filamentation as the supercontinuum generation mechanism to provide the ultrabroadband excitation pulses. We introduce a time-domain model of the CH$_4$ $\nu_2$ CRS spectrum, including all five ro-vibrational branches allowed by the selection rules $\Delta v = 1$, $\Delta J = 0$, $\pm1$, $\pm2$; the model includes collisional linewidths, computed according to a modified exponential gap scaling law and validated experimentally. The use of ultrabroadband CRS for in situ monitoring of the CH$_4$ chemistry is demonstrated in a laboratory CH$_4$/air diffusion flame: CRS measurements in the fingerprint region, performed across the laminar flame front, allow the simultaneous detection of molecular oxygen (O$_2$), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$), along with CH$_4$. Fundamental physicochemical processes, such as H$_2$ production via CH$_4$ pyrolysis, are observed through the Raman spectra of these chemical species. In addition, we demonstrate ro-vibrational CH$_4\nu_2$ CRS thermometry, and we validate it against CO$_2$ CRS measurements. The present technique offers an interesting diagnostics approach to in situ measurement of CH$_4$-rich environments, e.g., in plasma reactors for CH$_4$ pyrolysis and H$_2$ production.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Safety monitoring under stealthy sensor injection attacks using reachable sets**|Cédric Escudero et.al.|[2307.12715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12715v1)|null|Stealthy sensor injection attacks are serious threats for industrial plants as they can compromise the plant's integrity without being detected by traditional fault detectors. In this manuscript, we study the possibility of revealing the presence of such attacks by monitoring only the control input. This approach consists in computing an ellipsoidal bound of the input reachable set. When the control input does not belong to this set, this means that a stealthy sensor injection attack is driving the plant to critical states. The problem of finding this ellipsoidal bound is posed as a convex optimization problem (convex cost with Linear Matrix Inequalities constraints). Our monitoring approach is tested in simulation.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Rates in almost sure invariance principle for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps**|C Cuny et.al.|[2307.12714v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12714v1)|null|We prove the Almost Sure Invariance Principle (ASIP) with close to optimal error rates for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps. We do not assume exponential contraction along stable leaves, therefore our result covers in particular slowly mixing invertible dynamical systems as Bunimovich flowers, billiards with flat points as in Chernov and Zhang (2005) and Wojtkowski' (1990) system of two falling balls. For these examples, the ASIP is a new result, not covered by prior works for various reasons, notably because in absence of exponential contraction along stable leaves, it is challenging to employ the so-called Sinai's trick (Sinai 1972, Bowen 1975) of reducing a nonuniformly hyperbolic system to a nonuniformly expanding one. Our strategy follows our previous papers on the ASIP for nonuniformly expanding maps, where we build a semiconjugacy to a specific renewal Markov shift and adapt the argument of Berkes, Liu and Wu (2014). The main difference is that now the Markov shift is two-sided, the observables depend on the full trajectory, both the future and the past.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Process Mining (Technical Report)**|Alessandro Berti et.al.|[2307.12701v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12701v1)|null|This technical report describes the intersection of process mining and large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the abstraction of traditional and object-centric process mining artifacts into textual format. We introduce and explore various prompting strategies: direct answering, where the large language model directly addresses user queries; multi-prompt answering, which allows the model to incrementally build on the knowledge obtained through a series of prompts; and the generation of database queries, facilitating the validation of hypotheses against the original event log.   Our assessment considers two large language models, GPT-4 and Google's Bard, under various contextual scenarios across all prompting strategies. Results indicate that these models exhibit a robust understanding of key process mining abstractions, with notable proficiency in interpreting both declarative and procedural process models.   In addition, we find that both models demonstrate strong performance in the object-centric setting, which could significantly propel the advancement of the object-centric process mining discipline.   Additionally, these models display a noteworthy capacity to evaluate various concepts of fairness in process mining. This opens the door to more rapid and efficient assessments of the fairness of process mining event logs, which has significant implications for the field.   The integration of these large language models into process mining applications may open new avenues for exploration, innovation, and insight generation in the field.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Safe asynchronous mixed-choice for timed interactions**|Jonah Pears et.al.|[2307.12688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12688v1)|null|Mixed-choice has long been barred from models of asynchronous communication since it compromises key properties of communicating finite-state machines. Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a key programming feature to handle failures. To address this deficiency, we present (binary) TimeOut Asynchronous Session Types ({TOAST}) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types to permit mixed-choice. {TOAST} deploy timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for {TOAST} which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice. Building upon {TOAST}, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a $\mathtt{receive\text{-}after}$ pattern, much like Erlang, and informally illustrate the correspondence with TOAST specifications.|

In this paper, we build rational normal form with exact global control of small divisors. As an application to nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations in Gevrey spaces, we prove sub-exponentially long time stability results for generic small initial data.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Execution at RISC: Stealth JOP Attacks on RISC-V Applications**|Loïc Buckwell et.al.|[2307.12648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12648v1)|null|RISC-V is a recently developed open instruction set architecture gaining a lot of attention. To achieve a lasting security on these systems and design efficient countermeasures, a better understanding of vulnerabilities to novel and potential future attacks is mandatory. This paper demonstrates that RISC-V is sensible to Jump-Oriented Programming, a class of complex code-reuse attacks. We provide an analysis of new dispatcher gadgets we discovered, and show how they can be used together in order to build a stealth attack, bypassing existing protections. A proof-of-concept attack is implemented on an embedded web server compiled for RISC-V, in which we introduced a vulnerability, allowing an attacker to remotely read an arbitrary file from the host machine.|
|**2023-07-24**|**Remote Bio-Sensing: Open Source Benchmark Framework for Fair Evaluation of rPPG**|Dae Yeol Kim et.al.|[2307.12644v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12644v1)|[link](https://github.com/remotebiosensing/rppg)|Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a technology that utilizes the light absorption properties of hemoglobin, captured via camera, to analyze and measure blood volume pulse (BVP). By analyzing the measured BVP, various physiological signals such as heart rate, stress levels, and blood pressure can be derived, enabling applications such as the early prediction of cardiovascular diseases. rPPG is a rapidly evolving field as it allows the measurement of vital signals using camera-equipped devices without the need for additional devices such as blood pressure monitors or pulse oximeters, and without the assistance of medical experts. Despite extensive efforts and advances in this field, serious challenges remain, including issues related to skin color, camera characteristics, ambient lighting, and other sources of noise, which degrade performance accuracy. We argue that fair and evaluable benchmarking is urgently required to overcome these challenges and make any meaningful progress from both academic and commercial perspectives. In most existing work, models are trained, tested, and validated only on limited datasets. Worse still, some studies lack available code or reproducibility, making it difficult to fairly evaluate and compare performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide a benchmarking framework to evaluate various rPPG techniques across a wide range of datasets for fair evaluation and comparison, including both conventional non-deep neural network (non-DNN) and deep neural network (DNN) methods.

|**2023-07-24**|**Spectral Observations and Modeling of a Solar White-light Flare Observed by CHASE**|De-Chao Song et.al.|[2307.12641v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12641v1)|null|The heating mechanisms of solar white-light flares remain unclear. We present an X1.0 white-light flare on 2022 October 2 (SOL2022-10-02T20:25) observed by the Chinese \ha\ Solar Explorer (CHASE) that provides two-dimensional spectra in the visible light for the full solar disk with a seeing-free condition. The flare shows a prominent enhancement of $\sim$40\% in the photospheric \fe\ line at 6569.2 \AA, and the nearby continuum also exhibits a maximum enhancement of $\sim$40\%. For the continuum near the \fe\ line at 6173 \AA\ from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), it is enhanced up to $\sim$20\%. At the white-light kernels, the \fe\ line at 6569.2 \AA\ has a symmetric Gaussian profile that is still in absorption and the H$\alpha$ line at 6562.8 \AA\ displays a very broad emission profile with a central reversal plus a red or blue asymmetry. The white-light kernels are co-spatial with the microwave footpoint sources observed by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and the time profile of the white-light emission matches that of the hard X-ray emission above 30 keV from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on Fermi. These facts indicate that the white-light emission is qualitatively related to a nonthermal electron beam. We also perform a radiative hydrodynamic simulation with the electron beam parameters constrained by the hard X-ray observations from Fermi/GBM. The result reveals that the white-light enhancement cannot be well explained by a pure electron-beam heating together with its induced radiative backwarming but may need additional heating sources such as \alfven\ waves.|

However, there is no evidence of afterglow emission at such early time at other wavelengths. Here we report the discovery of a hidden afterglow component during the prompt emission phase with Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) observations. We analyze the spectral evolution of the X-ray/$\gamma$-ray emission of GRB 221009A measured by GBM during the dips of two prompt emission pulses (i.e., intervals $T_{0}+[300-328]\rm~s$ and $T_{0}+[338-378]\rm~s$, where $T_0$ is the GBM trigger time). We find that the spectra at the dips transit from the Band function to a power-law function, indicating a transition from the prompt emission to the afterglow. After $\sim T_{0}+ 660 \rm~s$, the spectrum is well described by a power-law function and the afterglow becomes dominant. Remarkably, the underlying afterglow emission at the dips smoothly connect with the afterglow after $\sim T_{0}+ 660 \rm~s$. The entire afterglow emission measured by GBM can be fitted by a power-law function $F\sim t^{-0.95\pm0.05}$, where $t$ is the time since the first main pulse at $T^*=T_0+226~{\rm s}$, consistent with the TeV afterglow decay measured by LHAASO. The start time of this power-law decay indicates that the afterglow peak of GRB 221009A should be earlier than $T_{0}+300 \rm ~s$. We also test the possible presence of a jet break in the early afterglow light curve, finding that both the jet break model and single power-law decay model are consistent with the GBM data. The two models can not be distinguished with the GBM data alone because the inferred jet break time is quite close to the end of GBM observations.|

Previous research and empirical studies have indicated that the amplitude spectrum plays a decisive role in CNN recognition, but it is susceptible to disturbance caused by distribution shifts. On the other hand, the phase spectrum preserves highly-structured spatial information, which is crucial for visual representation learning. In this paper, we aim to clarify the relationships between Domain Generalization (DG) and the frequency components by introducing a Fourier-based structural causal model. Specifically, we interpret the phase spectrum as semi-causal factors and the amplitude spectrum as non-causal factors. Building upon these observations, we propose Phase Match (PhaMa) to address DG problems. Our method introduces perturbations on the amplitude spectrum and establishes spatial relationships to match the phase components. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization and out-of-distribution robustness tasks.|
|**2023-07-24**|**CTVIS: Consistent Training for Online Video Instance Segmentation**|Kaining Ying et.al.|[2307.12616v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12616v1)|null|The discrimination of instance embeddings plays a vital role in associating instances across time for online video instance segmentation (VIS). Instance embedding learning is directly supervised by the contrastive loss computed upon the contrastive items (CIs), which are sets of anchor/positive/negative embeddings. Recent online VIS methods leverage CIs sourced from one reference frame only, which we argue is insufficient for learning highly discriminative embeddings. Intuitively, a possible strategy to enhance CIs is replicating the inference phase during training. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, called Consistent Training for Online VIS (CTVIS), which devotes to aligning the training and inference pipelines in terms of building CIs. Specifically, CTVIS constructs CIs by referring inference the momentum-averaged embedding and the memory bank storage mechanisms, and adding noise to the relevant embeddings. Such an extension allows a reliable comparison between embeddings of current instances and the stable representations of historical instances, thereby conferring an advantage in modeling VIS challenges such as occlusion, re-identification, and deformation. Empirically, CTVIS outstrips the SOTA VIS models by up to +5.0 points on three VIS benchmarks, including YTVIS19 (55.1% AP), YTVIS21 (50.1% AP) and OVIS (35.5% AP). Furthermore, we find that pseudo-videos transformed from images can train robust models surpassing fully-supervised ones.|
|**2023-07-24**|**BonnBot-I: A Precise Weed Management and Crop Monitoring Platform**|Alireza Ahmadi et.al.|[2307.12588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12588v1)|null|Cultivation and weeding are two of the primary tasks performed by farmers today. A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this paper we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches which can accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This improves tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field|

These services let libraries subscribe to pre-configured digital content packages that become instantly available wholesale to their patrons. However, these packages often contain content that does not align with the library's curation policy. We conducted interviews with 15 public librarians in the US to examine their experiences with subscribing to digital distribution services. We found that the subscribing libraries face many digital governance challenges, including the sub-par quality of received content, a lack of control in the curation process, and a limited understanding of how distribution services operate. We draw from prior HCI and social media moderation literature to contextualize and examine these challenges. Building upon our findings, we suggest how digital distributors, libraries, and lawmakers could improve digital distribution services in library settings. We offer recommendations for co-constructing a robust digital content curation policy and discuss how librarian's cooperation and well-deployed content moderation mechanisms could help enforce that policy. Our work informs the utility of future content moderation research that bridges the fields of CSCW and library science.|

Those functionalities are managed by configuring objects and resources in the control plane. Since most objects change their state depending on other objects' states, a change propagates to other objects in a chain. As cluster availability is influenced by the time required for these cascading changes, it is essential to make the propagations measurable and shed light on the behavior of the Kubernetes control plane. However, it is not easy because each object constantly monitors other objects' status and acts autonomously in response to their changes to play its role. In this paper, we propose a measurement system that outputs objects' change logs published from the API server in the control plane and assists in analyzing the time of cascading changes between objects by utilizing the relationships among resources. With a practical change scenario, our system is confirmed that it can measure change propagation times within a cascading change. Also, measurements on the system itself showed it has a small CPU and memory footprint.|

However, such a setup that builds relationships between complicated anomalous events and single labels, e.g., ``vandalism'', is superficial, since single labels are deficient to characterize anomalous events. In reality, users tend to search a specific video rather than a series of approximate videos. Therefore, retrieving anomalous events using detailed descriptions is practical and positive but few researches focus on this. In this context, we propose a novel task called Video Anomaly Retrieval (VAR), which aims to pragmatically retrieve relevant anomalous videos by cross-modalities, e.g., language descriptions and synchronous audios. Unlike the current video retrieval where videos are assumed to be temporally well-trimmed with short duration, VAR is devised to retrieve long untrimmed videos which may be partially relevant to the given query. To achieve this, we present two large-scale VAR benchmarks, UCFCrime-AR and XDViolence-AR, constructed on top of prevalent anomaly datasets. Meanwhile, we design a model called Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN) for VAR. In ALAN, we propose an anomaly-led sampling to focus on key segments in long untrimmed videos. Then, we introduce an efficient pretext task to enhance semantic associations between video-text fine-grained representations. Besides, we leverage two complementary alignments to further match cross-modal contents. Experimental results on two benchmarks reveal the challenges of VAR task and also demonstrate the advantages of our tailored method.|

Revolutionary quantum applications are now in the limelight, showcasing the advantages of quantum information technology and becoming a research hotspot in academia and industry. To enable quantum applications to have a more profound impact and wider application, the interconnection of multiple quantum nodes through quantum channels becomes essential. Building an entanglement-assisted quantum network, capable of realizing quantum information transmission between these quantum nodes, is the primary goal. However, entanglement-assisted quantum networks are governed by the unique laws of quantum mechanics, such as the superposition principle, the no-cloning theorem, and quantum entanglement, setting them apart from classical networks. Consequently, fundamental efforts are required to establish entanglement-assisted quantum networks. While some insightful surveys have paved the way for entanglement-assisted quantum networks, most of these studies focus on enabling technologies and quantum applications, neglecting critical network issues. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of entanglement-assisted quantum networks. Alongside reviewing fundamental mechanics and enabling technologies, the paper provides a detailed overview of the network structure, working principles, and development stages, highlighting the differences from classical networks. Additionally, the challenges of building wide-area entanglement-assisted quantum networks are addressed. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes open research directions, including architecture design, entanglement-based network issues, and standardization, to facilitate the implementation of future entanglement-assisted quantum networks.|

However, automatically generating correct and robust fuzz drivers is a difficult task. Compared to existing approaches, LLM-based (Large Language Model) generation is a promising direction due to its ability to operate with low requirements on consumer programs, leverage multiple dimensions of API usage information, and generate human-friendly output code. Nonetheless, the challenges and effectiveness of LLM-based fuzz driver generation remain unclear.   To address this, we conducted a study on the effects, challenges, and techniques of LLM-based fuzz driver generation. Our study involved building a quiz with 86 fuzz driver generation questions from 30 popular C projects, constructing precise effectiveness validation criteria for each question, and developing a framework for semi-automated evaluation. We designed five query strategies, evaluated 36,506 generated fuzz drivers. Furthermore, the drivers were compared with manually written ones to obtain practical insights. Our evaluation revealed that:   while the overall performance was promising (passing 91% of questions), there were still practical challenges in filtering out the ineffective fuzz drivers for large scale application; basic strategies achieved a decent correctness rate (53%), but struggled with complex API-specific usage questions. In such cases, example code snippets and iterative queries proved helpful; while LLM-generated drivers showed competent fuzzing outcomes compared to manually written ones, there was still significant room for improvement, such as incorporating semantic oracles for logical bugs detection.|

Usually, spectra are determined by averaging the data matrix, which does not take into account the significant thermal drifts that occur in the measurement process. In contrast, we present an asymptotic analysis for the homoscedastic drift model, a pioneering parametric model that achieves striking model fits in practice and allows both hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for spectra. The ENDOR spectrum and an orthogonal component are modeled as an element of complex projective space, and formulated in the framework of generalized Fr\'echet means. To this end, two general formulations of strong consistency for set-valued Fr\'echet means are extended and subsequently applied to the homoscedastic drift model to prove strong consistency. Building on this, central limit theorems for the ENDOR spectrum are shown. Furthermore, we extend applicability by taking into account a phase noise contribution leading to the heteroscedastic drift model. Both drift models offer improved signal-to-noise ratio over pre-existing models.|
