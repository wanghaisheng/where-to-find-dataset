|**2024-07-05**|**Investigating the Mass of the Black Hole and Possible Wind Outflow of the Accretion Disk in the Tidal Disruption Event AT2021ehb**|Xin Xiang et.al.|[2407.04684v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04684v1)|null|Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can potentially probe low-mass black holes in host galaxies that might not adhere to bulge or stellar-dispersion relationships. At least initially, TDEs can also reveal super-Eddington accretion. X-ray spectroscopy can potentially constrain black hole masses, and reveal ionized outflows associated with super-Eddington accretion. Our analysis of XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the TDE AT2021ehb, around 300 days post-disruption, reveals a soft spectrum and can be fit with a combination of multi-color disk blackbody and power-law components. Using two independent disk models with properties suited to TDEs, we estimate a black hole mass at $M \simeq 10^{5.5}~M_{\odot}$, indicating AT2021ehb may expose the elusive low-mass end of the nuclear black hole population. These models offer simple yet robust characterization; more complicated models are not required, but provide important context and caveats in the limit of moderately sensitive data. If disk reflection is included, the disk flux is lower and inferred black hole masses are $\sim$ 0.35 dex higher. Simple wind formulations imply an extremely fast $v_{\mathrm{out}} = -0.2~c$ outflow and obviate a disk continuum component. Assuming a unity filling factor, such a wind implies an instantaneous mass outflow rate of $\dot{M} \simeq 5~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Such a high rate suggests that the filling factor for the Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) must be extremely low, and/or the UFO phase is ephemeral. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our analysis and avenues for future observations of TDEs.|

Classic end-to-end models fused with extra language models perform well, but mainly in data matching scenarios and are gradually approaching a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Seed-ASR, a large language model (LLM) based speech recognition model. Seed-ASR is developed based on the framework of audio conditioned LLM (AcLLM), leveraging the capabilities of LLMs by inputting continuous speech representations together with contextual information into the LLM. Through stage-wise large-scale training and the elicitation of context-aware capabilities in LLM, Seed-ASR demonstrates significant improvement over end-to-end models on comprehensive evaluation sets, including multiple domains, accents/dialects and languages. Additionally, Seed-ASR can be further deployed to support specific needs in various scenarios without requiring extra language models. Compared to recently released large ASR models, Seed-ASR achieves 10%-40% reduction in word (or character, for Chinese) error rates on Chinese and English public test sets, further demonstrating its powerful performance.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion**|Sarah N. Bentley et.al.|[2407.04669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669v1)|null|Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Metastability of the contact process on slowly evolving scale-free networks**|Emmanuel Jacob et.al.|[2407.04654v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04654v1)|null|We investigate the contact process on scale-free networks evolving by a stationary dynamics whereby each vertex independently updates its connections with a rate depending on its power. This rate can be slowed down or speeded up by virtue of decreasing or increasing a parameter $\eta$, with $\eta\downarrow-\infty$ approaching the static and $\eta\uparrow\infty$ the mean-field case. We identify the regimes of slow, fast and ultra-fast extinction of the contact process. Slow extinction occurs in the form of metastability, when the contact process maintains a certain density of infected states for a time exponential in the network size. In our main result we identify the metastability exponents, which describe the decay of metastable densities as the infection rate goes to zero, in dependence on $\eta$ and the power-law exponent $\tau$. While the fast evolution cases have been treated in a companion paper, Jacob, Linker, M\"orters (2019), the present paper looks at the significantly more difficult cases of slow network evolution. We describe various effects, like degradation, regeneration and depletion, which lead to a rich picture featuring numerous first-order phase transitions for the metastable exponents. To capture these effects in our upper bounds we develop a new martingale based proof technique combining a local and global analysis of the process.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Quantized circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: The many-body Chern number as seen from the edge**|F. Nur Ãœnal et.al.|[2407.04639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639v1)|null|Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines the quantized value of the Hall conductivity. Interestingly, this topological property can also be accessed through a dissipative response, by subjecting the system to a circular drive and comparing excitation rates obtained for opposite orientations of the drive. This quantized circular dichroism assumes that only the bulk contributes to the response. Indeed, in a confined and isolated system, the edge contribution exactly cancels the bulk response. This work explores an important corollary of the latter observation: If properly isolated, the circular dichroic response stemming from the edge of a quantum Hall droplet must be quantized, thus providing an appealing way to probe the many-body Chern number. Importantly, we demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms. Edge dichroic responses emerge as a practical probe for strongly-correlated topological phases, accessible in cold-atom experiments.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Deep sections of the hypercube**|Lionel Pournin et.al.|[2407.04637v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04637v1)|null|Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.|
|**2024-07-05**|**An autoencoder for compressing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data**|Steinn Ymir Agustsson et.al.|[2407.04631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04631v1)|null|Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique to determine the electronic structure of solids. Advances in light sources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data acquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most advanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast, effective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response to this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that efficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a large and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting standard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in $\mathbf{k}$. To test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare $k$-means clustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by discrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet data excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Cosmological constraints from the cross-correlation of DESI Luminous Red Galaxies with CMB lensing from Planck PR4 and ACT DR6**|Noah Sailer et.al.|[2407.04607v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04607v1)|null|We infer the growth of large scale structure over the redshift range $0.4\lesssim z \lesssim 1$ from the cross-correlation of spectroscopically calibrated Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) legacy imaging survey with CMB lensing maps reconstructed from the latest Planck and ACT data. We adopt a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model that robustly regulates the cosmological information obtainable from smaller scales, such that our cosmological constraints are reliably derived from the (predominantly) linear regime. We perform an extensive set of bandpower- and parameter-level systematics checks to ensure the robustness of our results and to characterize the uniformity of the LRG sample. We demonstrate that our results are stable to a wide range of modeling assumptions, finding excellent agreement with a linear theory analysis performed on a restricted range of scales. From a tomographic analysis of the four LRG photometric redshift bins we find that the rate of structure growth is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM with an overall amplitude that is $\simeq5-7\%$ lower than predicted by primary CMB measurements with modest $(\sim2\sigma)$ statistical significance. From the combined analysis of all four bins and their cross-correlations with Planck we obtain $S_8 = 0.765\pm0.023$, which is less discrepant with primary CMB measurements than previous DESI LRG cross Planck CMB lensing results. From the cross-correlation with ACT we obtain $S_8 = 0.790^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, while when jointly analyzing Planck and ACT we find $S_8 = 0.775^{+0.019}_{-0.022}$ from our data alone and $\sigma_8 = 0.772^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$ with the addition of BAO data. These constraints are consistent with the latest Planck primary CMB analyses at the $\simeq 1.6-2.2\sigma$ level, and are in excellent agreement with galaxy lensing surveys.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Weak coloring numbers of minor-closed graph classes**|JÄ™drzej Hodor et.al.|[2407.04588v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04588v1)|null|We study the growth rate of weak coloring numbers of graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor. Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017) showed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of $X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(r \log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the polynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result, for a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \mathcal{O}(r^{\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\mathrm{log}\ r)$, which improves on the bound $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \mathcal{O}(r^{g(\mathrm{td}(X))})$ given by Dujmovi\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function. In the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number is in $\mathcal{O}(r^2\mathrm{log}\ r$), which is best possible.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Optimal Mixing for Randomly Sampling Edge Colorings on Trees Down to the Max Degree**|Charlie Carlson et.al.|[2407.04576v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04576v1)|null|We address the convergence rate of Markov chains for randomly generating an edge coloring of a given tree. Our focus is on the Glauber dynamics which updates the color at a randomly chosen edge in each step. For a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$, when the number of colors $q$ satisfies $q\geq\Delta+2$ then we prove that the Glauber dynamics has an optimal relaxation time of $O(n)$, where the relaxation time is the inverse of the spectral gap. This is optimal in the range of $q$ in terms of $\Delta$ as Dyer, Goldberg, and Jerrum (2006) showed that the relaxation time is $\Omega(n^3)$ when $q=\Delta+1$. For the case $q=\Delta+1$, we show that an alternative Markov chain which updates a pair of neighboring edges has relaxation time $O(n)$. Moreover, for the $\Delta$-regular complete tree we prove $O(n\log^2{n})$ mixing time bounds for the respective Markov chain. Our proofs establish approximate tensorization of variance via a novel inductive approach, where the base case is a tree of height $\ell=O(\Delta^2\log^2{\Delta})$, which we analyze using a canonical paths argument.|
|**2024-07-05**|**An SDE Perspective on Stochastic Inertial Gradient Dynamics with Time-Dependent Viscosity and Geometric Damping**|Rodrigo Maulen-Soto et.al.|[2407.04562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04562v1)|null|Our approach is part of the close link between continuous dissipative dynamical systems and optimization algorithms. We aim to solve convex minimization problems by means of stochastic inertial differential equations which are driven by the gradient of the objective function. This will provide a general mathematical framework for analyzing fast optimization algorithms with stochastic gradient input. Our study is a natural extension of our previous work devoted to the first-order in time stochastic steepest descent. Our goal is to develop these results further by considering second-order stochastic differential equations in time, incorporating a viscous time-dependent damping and a Hessian-driven damping. To develop this program, we rely on stochastic Lyapunov analysis. Assuming a square-integrability condition on the diffusion term times a function dependant on the viscous damping, and that the Hessian-driven damping is a positive constant, our first main result shows that almost surely, there is convergence of the values, and states fast convergence of the values in expectation. Besides, in the case where the Hessian-driven damping is zero, we conclude with the fast convergence of the values in expectation and in almost sure sense, we also managed to prove almost sure weak convergence of the trajectory. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis by establishing several new pointwise and ergodic convergence rates in expectation for the convex and strongly convex case.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Spontaneous Reward Hacking in Iterative Self-Refinement**|Jane Pan et.al.|[2407.04549v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04549v1)|null|Language models are capable of iteratively improving their outputs based on natural language feedback, thus enabling in-context optimization of user preference. In place of human users, a second language model can be used as an evaluator, providing feedback along with numerical ratings which the generator attempts to optimize. However, because the evaluator is an imperfect proxy of user preference, this optimization can lead to reward hacking, where the evaluator's ratings improve while the generation quality remains stagnant or even decreases as judged by actual user preference. The concern of reward hacking is heightened in iterative self-refinement where the generator and the evaluator use the same underlying language model, in which case the optimization pressure can drive them to exploit shared vulnerabilities. Using an essay editing task, we show that iterative self-refinement leads to deviation between the language model evaluator and human judgment, demonstrating that reward hacking can occur spontaneously in-context with the use of iterative self-refinement. In addition, we study conditions under which reward hacking occurs and observe two factors that affect reward hacking severity: model size and context sharing between the generator and the evaluator.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Implications of the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections for the strength of solar cycle 25**|Nat Gopalswamy et.al.|[2407.04548v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04548v1)|null|We assess the relative strength of solar cycle (SC) 25 with respect to SCs 23 and 24 based on the abundance of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We make use of the halo CME database (https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/halo/halo.html) to compare the halo CME abundance during the first four years in each of SCs 23 to 25. The main result is that in several aspects such as the abundance, occurrence rate, source locations, and halo heights, halo CMEs are similar between SCs 24 and 25 but different from SC 23. This result follows from the fact that weaker cycles have low heliospheric total pressure, whose backreaction on CMEs allows them to expand more and hence enhancing the chance of becoming a halo. The solar cycle variation of halo CME properties is consistent with the precursor-based cycle prediction methods that indicate SC 25 is similar to or only slightly stronger than SC 24.|

To supply these many wavelengths of light, broadband sources are required, and spectrometers are employed to distinguish power per wavelength. Current multi-channel bNIRS instruments are bulky and only semi-portable due to technological limitations. We propose a design for a bNIRS device that has been miniaturized to allow for portable use. This design leverages the innovations in photonic devices that have created a new line of microspectrometers and broadband NIR high-power LEDs; the Hamamatsu SMD-type spectrometer C14384MA and the Ushio SMBBIR45-1100 LED. This first-of-itskind device, referred to as microCYRIL (after its two predecessors CYRIL and miniCYRIL), has been developed for oxygenation and metabolism measurements with dual channel operation. To verify functionality, concentration changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin and oxCCO were successfully tracked during a cuff-induced venous and arterial occlusion.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Analysis of SIR Reaction diffusion system with constant birth and death rate**|Yiting Yao et.al.|[2407.04509v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04509v1)|null|This is a truncation of the second year group project at Imperial college london. In this paper, we consider a semilinear reaction diffusion system of SIR model which involves the birth rate and the death rate. We first prove the non-negativity and global existence theorem to ensure that the model makes sense. We prove the uniform convergence of the infection-free solution and study an example that separable solutions can be computed. We also focus on the steady state solution, which we prove the non-uniqueness of the solution and investigate the regularity of the general solution. In the end we also introduce an interesting phenomenon, which is called the Turing instability caused by the diffusion in the model.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Layer-Dependent Charge State Lifetime of Single Se Vacancies in WSe$_2$**|Laric Bobzien et.al.|[2407.04508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04508v1)|null|Defect engineering in two-dimensional semiconductors has been exploited to tune the optoelectronic properties and introduce new quantum states in the band gap. Chalcogen vacancies in transition metal dichalcogenides in particular have been found to strongly impact charge carrier concentration and mobility in 2D transistors as well as feature sub-gap emission and single-photon response. In this letter, we investigate the layer-dependent charge state lifetime of Se vacancies in WSe$_2$. In one monolayer WSe$_2$, we observe ultrafast charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied orbital of the top Se vacancy to the graphene substrate within (1.0 $\pm$ 0.2) ps measured via the current saturation in scanning tunneling approach curves. For Se vacancies decoupled by TMD multilayers, we find a sub-exponential increase of the charge lifetime from (62 $\pm$ 14) ps in bilayer to few nanoseconds in four-layer WSe$_2$, alongside a reduction of the defect state binding energy. Additionally, we attribute the continuous suppression and energy shift of the dI/dV in-gap defect state resonances at very close tip--sample distances to a current saturation effect. Our results provide a key measure of the layer-dependent charge transfer rate of chalcogen vacancies in TMDs.|

Furthermore, with Lions' dissipation exponent $\alpha\geq \frac{5}{4}$, we verify the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial fluid velocity and oxygen concentration. These results reflect the influence of the generalized dissipation for the solutions of the coupled chemotaxis-fluid equations. Finally, in the scenario of weaker dissipation ($\frac{3}{4}<\alpha<\frac{5}{4}$), we establish uniform regularity estimates for global strong solutions and further obtain optimal time-decay rates under the mild condition that the initial $L^2$ energy is small. To our knowledge, this is the first result concerning the global existence and large-time behavior of strong solutions for the three-dimensional chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes equations with possibly large oscillations.|

Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of data generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy production rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic thermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise schedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and the optimal transport.|

These affect the continuous-time plant in a rational way which is then modeled as a Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT). Based on a zero-order-hold (ZOH) LFT discretization process at the cost of bounded quantifiable approximations, and then using LFT-preserving down-sampling operations, a single-rate discrete-time closed-loop LFT model is derived. Interestingly, for any step inputs, and any admissible values of the uncertain parameters, the outputs of this model cover those of the initial hybrid multi-rate closed-loop system at every sampling time of the slowest control loop. Such an LFT model, which also captures the discretization errors, can then be used to evaluate both robust stability and guaranteed $H_\infty$ performance with a $\mu$-based approach. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a realistic and easily reproducible example inspired by the validation of multi-rate attitude control systems.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Decoupling NO production and UV emission intensity over the E-H mode transition in a low-pressure inductively coupled plasma device**|Lars SchÃ¼cke et.al.|[2407.04441v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04441v1)|null|A low-pressure double-inductively coupled plasma device is used to study the fundamental plasma parameters, plasma chemistry, and UV photon emission from the first excited state of nitric oxide, NO(A), in gas mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. In addition to the gas mixture, rf power and gas pressure are varied, and the E-H mode transition of the inductively coupled plasma is studied specifically. The gas temperature and UV photon emission are measured by optical emission spectroscopy (OES), the absolute density of the nitric oxide electronic ground state by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF), as well as electron density and electron temperature by a multipole resonance probe (MRP). A simple collisional-radiative model for UV emission from NO(A) is developed, which takes the measured densities of ground state nitric oxide and electrons, as well as the electron temperature and neutral gas temperature, as input parameters. The results reveal the links between the absolute densities of ground state nitric oxide, the excitation of this species driven by electron impact and collisions with nitrogen metastables, quenching of the nitrogen metastables, and the resulting UV photon emission rate. The density of ground state nitric oxide is shown to increase with power, while the discharge remains in E-mode, and to decrease significantly with the transition into H-mode, when sufficient rf power is deposited in the discharge. Despite the lower densities of ground state nitric oxide in H-mode, the UV photon emission intensity increases continuously with higher rf powers and over the E-H transition. This effect is shown to be caused by increased excitation of NO(A) by nitrogen metastables in H-mode, which is sufficient to overcompensate the decrease in ground state nitric oxide density.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Trustworthy Classification through Rank-Based Conformal Prediction Sets**|Rui Luo et.al.|[2407.04407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04407v1)|null|Machine learning classification tasks often benefit from predicting a set of possible labels with confidence scores to capture uncertainty. However, existing methods struggle with the high-dimensional nature of the data and the lack of well-calibrated probabilities from modern classification models. We propose a novel conformal prediction method that employs a rank-based score function suitable for classification models that predict the order of labels correctly, even if not well-calibrated. Our approach constructs prediction sets that achieve the desired coverage rate while managing their size. We provide a theoretical analysis of the expected size of the conformal prediction sets based on the rank distribution of the underlying classifier. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques on various datasets, providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Our contributions include a novel conformal prediction method, theoretical analysis, and empirical evaluation. This work advances the practical deployment of machine learning systems by enabling reliable uncertainty quantification.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Existence of a maximum flow rate in electro-osmotic systems**|Sleeba Varghese et.al.|[2407.04390v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04390v1)|null|In this work, we investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic wall-fluid friction in electro-osmotic flows. First, we present the solution to the electro-hydrodynamic equation for the electro-osmotic velocity profile, which is derived for an ionic system composed of cations immersed in uncharged solvent particles. The system (solution and walls) is kept electrically neutral using negatively charged walls and will here be referred to as a "counterion-only" system. The theory predicts the existence of a counterion concentration that results in a maximum electro-osmotic flow rate, but only if the wall-fluid friction, or equivalently the slip length, is correlated with the system electrostatic screening length. Through equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we precisely determine the hydrodynamic slip from the wall-fluid friction, and this is then used as input to the theoretical predictions. Comparison between the theory and independent non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation data confirms the existence of the maximum. Also, we find that standard hydrodynamic theory quantitatively agrees with simulation results for charged nanoscale systems for sufficiently small charge densities and ion charges, if the correct slip boundaries are applied.|
|**2024-07-05**|**An Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Method with Non-negative Gauss-Newton Stepsizes**|Antonio Orvieto et.al.|[2407.04358v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04358v1)|null|We consider the problem of minimizing the average of a large number of smooth but possibly non-convex functions. In the context of most machine learning applications, each loss function is non-negative and thus can be expressed as the composition of a square and its real-valued square root. This reformulation allows us to apply the Gauss-Newton method, or the Levenberg-Marquardt method when adding a quadratic regularization. The resulting algorithm, while being computationally as efficient as the vanilla stochastic gradient method, is highly adaptive and can automatically warmup and decay the effective stepsize while tracking the non-negative loss landscape. We provide a tight convergence analysis, leveraging new techniques, in the stochastic convex and non-convex settings. In particular, in the convex case, the method does not require access to the gradient Lipshitz constant for convergence, and is guaranteed to never diverge. The convergence rates and empirical evaluations compare favorably to the classical (stochastic) gradient method as well as to several other adaptive methods.|

Posselt et.al.|[2407.04337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04337v1)|null|The X-ray thermal isolated neutron star (XTINS) RX J0806.4--4123 shows interesting multiwavelength properties that seemingly deviate from those of similar neutron stars. An accurate determination of the spin frequency change over time can assist in interpreting RX J0806.4-4123's properties in comparison to those of other XTINSs and the wider pulsar population. From 2019 to 2023 we carried out a tailored X-ray timing campaign of RX J0806.4-4123 with the NICER instrument. We used statistical properties of the Fourier coefficients and the $Z_K^2$ test for phase-connecting separate observations and finding a timing solution for the entire dataset. We also developed a simple and universal method for estimating the uncertainties of frequency $\nu$ and its derivative $\dot{\nu}$ from the empirical dependencies of $Z_K^2$ on trial values of these parameters, with account of all significant harmonics of the frequency. Applying this method, we determined a spin-down rate $\dot{\nu} = -7.3(1.2)\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm Hz\, s}^{-1}$. The resulting spin-down power $\dot{E}=2.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is the lowest among the XTINSs, and it is a factor of 60 lower than the X-ray luminosity of this neutron star. RX J0806.4-4123 is also among the pulsars with the lowest measured $\dot{E}$ in general.|

When all reaction rates are constant, the equations are the following: \begin{align*}\frac{dv}{dt} & =-vw+v\sum_{j=2}^{\infty}c_{j}, \qquad \frac{dw}{dt} =vw-w\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}c_{j}, \\ \frac{dc_{j}}{dt} & =J_{j-1}-J_{j}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ \ \ J_{j}=wc_{j}-vc_{j+1}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ J_{0}=0, \end{align*} where $v$ and $w$ are two distinct unit species, and $c_i$ represents the concentration of clusters containing $i$ units.   We study in detail the mechanisms leading to such oscillations and characterise the different phases of the dynamics, from the initial high-amplitude oscillations to the progressive damping leading to the convergence towards the unique positive stationary solution. We give quantitative approximations for the main quantities of interest: period of the oscillations, size of the damping (corresponding to a loss of energy), number of oscillations characterising each phase. We illustrate these results by numerical simulation, in line with the theoretical results, and provide numerical methods to solve the system.|

The nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical, defocusing and analytic. Under geometric control condition on both coupling and damping regions, we establish the exponential energy decay rate.|

Aladyshkin et.al.|[2407.04299v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04299v1)|null|Local structural and electronic properties of thin Pb(111) films grown on Si(111)7x7 surface are experimentally studied by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). It is shown that the visible height $h$ of the monatomic step on Pb(111) surface demonstrates oscillatory dependence on bias voltage $U$. The period of these oscillations coincides with the period of the oscillations of both local tunneling conductance ($dI/dU$) and the rate of the STM tip displacement ($dZ/dU$) at sweeping $U$. It points to the fact that the observed oscillations of the visible height of monatomic Pb(111) step are controlled by coherent resonant tunneling of electrons from the STM tip to Pb(111) film through quantum-well states in thin Pb(111) film. We argue that the maximum and minimum visible heights of the monatomic Pb(111) step correspond to the bias voltages, at which local densities of states for the Pb(111) terraces of different thicknesses are equal.|

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki|

A Large-Scale Experiment Using In-the-Wild Data**|Hitoshi Suda et.al.|[2407.04270v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04270v1)|null|This paper introduces CocoNut-Humoresque, an open-source large-scale speech likability corpus that includes speech segments and their per-listener likability scores. Evaluating voice likability is essential to designing preferable voices for speech systems, such as dialogue or announcement systems. In this study, we let 885 listeners rate 1800 speech segments of a wide range of speakers regarding their likability. When constructing the corpus, we also collected the multiple speaker attributes: genders, ages, and favorite YouTube videos. Therefore, the corpus enables the large-scale statistical analysis of voice likability regarding both speaker and listener factors. This paper describes the construction methodology and preliminary data analysis to reveal the gender and age biases in voice likability. In addition, the relationship between the likability and two acoustic features, the fundamental frequencies and the x-vectors of given utterances, is also investigated.|

Chen et.al.|[2407.04264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04264v1)|null|We study the problem of non-convex optimization using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). SGLD is a natural and popular variation of stochastic gradient descent where at each step, appropriately scaled Gaussian noise is added. To our knowledge, the only strategy for showing global convergence of SGLD on the loss function is to show that SGLD can sample from a stationary distribution which assigns larger mass when the function is small (the Gibbs measure), and then to convert these guarantees to optimization results.   We employ a new strategy to analyze the convergence of SGLD to global minima, based on Lyapunov potentials and optimization. We convert the same mild conditions from previous works on SGLD into geometric properties based on Lyapunov potentials. This adapts well to the case with a stochastic gradient oracle, which is natural for machine learning applications where one wants to minimize population loss but only has access to stochastic gradients via minibatch training samples. Here we provide 1) improved rates in the setting of previous works studying SGLD for optimization, 2) the first finite gradient complexity guarantee for SGLD where the function is Lipschitz and the Gibbs measure defined by the function satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality, and 3) prove if continuous-time Langevin Dynamics succeeds for optimization, then discrete-time SGLD succeeds under mild regularity assumptions.|
