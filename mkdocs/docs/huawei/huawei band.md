|**2024-07-05**|**Stellar Metallicities and Gradients in the Faint M31 Satellites Andromeda XVI and Andromeda XXVIII**|Sal Wanying Fu et.al.|[2407.04698v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04698v1)|null|We present $\sim300$ stellar metallicity measurements in two faint M31 dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XVI ($M_V = -7.5$) and Andromeda XXVIII ($M_V = -8.8$) derived using metallicity-sensitive Calcium H & K narrow-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These are the first individual stellar metallicities in And~XVI (95 stars). Our And~XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of $\sim15$ increase over literature metallicities. For And~XVI, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.17^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.23\pm0.15$ dex $R_e^{-1}$. We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than MW UFDs of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -1.95^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.34^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.46 \pm 0.10$~dex~$R_e^{-1}$, placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function with an abrupt metal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The stellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint ($L \lesssim 10^6~L_{\odot}$) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies' gradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an age-gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar feedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal poor ($\mbox{[Fe/H]} < -3.0$) star candidates, which make up 7% of And~XVI's MDF and 6% of And~XXVIII's.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Suitability of Common Ingestible Antennas for Multiplexed Gastrointestinal Biosensing**|Erdem Cil et.al.|[2407.04566v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04566v1)|null|Ingestible sensor devices, which are increasingly used for internal health monitoring, rely on antennas to perform sensing functions and simultaneously to communicate with external devices. Despite the development of various ingestible antennas, there has been no comprehensive comparison of their performance as biosensors. This paper addresses this gap by examining and comparing the suitability of three common types of ingestible antennas -- dipole, patch, and loop -- as biosensors for distinguishing gastrointestinal tissues (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) based on their electromagnetic properties. The antennas studied in this work conform to the inner surface of biocompatible polylactic acid capsules with varying shell thicknesses and operate in the 433 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band. The comparison is performed in gastrointestinal tissues using several antenna parameters: 1) Sensing Capability: Changes in the phase of the reflection coefficient in the tissues are selected as the sensing parameter. 2) Robustness: The frequency interval (f_i) in which the antennas are matched (|S11| < -10 dB) in all the tissues and the maximum change in the center frequency (f_c) in different tissues are examined. 3) Radiation Performance: The gain and radiation efficiency of the antennas are examined. The effect of shell thickness on gain and radiation efficiency at 434 MHz is presented. Additionally, the radiation efficiency at various frequencies allocated for medical communications is compared with the theoretical maximum achievable efficiencies. These comprehensive data provide valuable information for making engineering decisions when designing multiplexed biosensor antennas for ingestible applications.|

Wireless spectrum serves as the blood and flesh of wireless communications. Shared white spaces such as those in the TVWS and CBRS spectrum bands offer opportunities to expand connectivity, innovate, and provide affordable access to high-speed Internet in under-served areas without additional cost to expensive licensed spectrum. However, the current methods to utilize these white spaces are inefficient due to very conservative models and spectrum policies, causing under-utilization of valuable spectrum resources. This hampers the full potential of innovative wireless technologies that could benefit farmers, small Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) operating in rural regions. This study explores the challenges faced by farmers and service providers when using shared spectrum bands to deploy their networks while ensuring maximum system performance and minimizing interference with other users. Additionally, we discuss how spatiotemporal spectrum models, in conjunction with database-driven spectrum-sharing solutions, can enhance the allocation and management of spectrum resources, ultimately improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless networks operating in shared spectrum bands.|
|**2024-07-05**|**The Nature of the High-energy Gamma-Ray Radiation Associated with the High-redshift Blazar B3 1343+451**|Fan Wu et.al.|[2407.04553v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04553v1)|null|High-redshift blazars are the most powerful extragalactic astrophysical sources ever detected in the high-energy gamma-ray band. In this study, we present a temporal and spectral analysis of the high-redshift blazar B3 1343+451 based on 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations, spanning from 2008 August 4 to 2022 June 6 (MJD 54686-59733). We extract a seven-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve in the energy range 0.1--500 GeV and identify seven outburst periods with a peak flux of $>4.32\times10^{-7} \rm ph \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$. The highest seven day flux (above 100 MeV) reaches $(8.06\pm0.56)\times10^{-7} \rm erg \ cm^{-2} \ s^{-1}$ on MJD = 56,177.16, which is 10 times higher than the flux in the quiescent period. To understand the properties of distant blazar jets, we employ a standard one-zone leptonic scenario and model the multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of one quiescent and seven flaring periods. We find that the $\gamma$-ray spectrum is better reproduced if we assume that the dissipation region of the jet, $R_{\rm diss}$, is located within the molecular torus, where infrared emission is the dominant external photon field. We infer that the jets in higher-redshift blazars have larger power and kinetic energy, where the kinetic energy is significantly greater than the radiation power, and the jet production efficiency suggests that we need to lower the accretion efficiency. These results imply that B3 1343+451 may have a standard thin disk surrounding its massive black hole, and the jets of B3 1343+451 may not be fully explained by the Blandford--Payne process.|
|**2024-07-05**|**More is Different: Mobile Ions Improve the Design Tolerances of Perovskite Solar Cells**|Lucy J. F. Hart et.al.|[2407.04523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04523v1)|null|Many recent advances in metal halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) performance are attributed to surface treatments which passivate interfacial trap states, minimise charge recombination and boost photovoltages. Surprisingly, these photovoltages exceed the cells' built-in potentials, often with large energetic offsets reported between the perovskite and transport layer semiconductor band edges - contradicting standard photovoltaic design principles. Here we show that this tolerance to energetic offsets results from mixed ionic/electronic conduction in the perovskite layer. Combining drift-diffusion simulations with experiments probing the current-voltage performance of PSCs as a function of ion distribution, we demonstrate that electrostatic redistribution of ionic charge reduces surface recombination currents at steady-state, increasing the photovoltage by tens to hundreds of millivolts. Thus, mobile ions can reduce the sensitivity of photovoltage to energetic misalignments at perovskite/transport layer interfaces, benefitting overall efficiency. Building on these insights, we show how photovoltaic design principles are modified to account for mobile ions.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Layer-Dependent Charge State Lifetime of Single Se Vacancies in WSe$_2$**|Laric Bobzien et.al.|[2407.04508v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04508v1)|null|Defect engineering in two-dimensional semiconductors has been exploited to tune the optoelectronic properties and introduce new quantum states in the band gap. Chalcogen vacancies in transition metal dichalcogenides in particular have been found to strongly impact charge carrier concentration and mobility in 2D transistors as well as feature sub-gap emission and single-photon response. In this letter, we investigate the layer-dependent charge state lifetime of Se vacancies in WSe$_2$. In one monolayer WSe$_2$, we observe ultrafast charge transfer from the lowest unoccupied orbital of the top Se vacancy to the graphene substrate within (1.0 $\pm$ 0.2) ps measured via the current saturation in scanning tunneling approach curves. For Se vacancies decoupled by TMD multilayers, we find a sub-exponential increase of the charge lifetime from (62 $\pm$ 14) ps in bilayer to few nanoseconds in four-layer WSe$_2$, alongside a reduction of the defect state binding energy. Additionally, we attribute the continuous suppression and energy shift of the dI/dV in-gap defect state resonances at very close tip--sample distances to a current saturation effect. Our results provide a key measure of the layer-dependent charge transfer rate of chalcogen vacancies in TMDs.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Magnetic-induced force noise in LISA Pathfinder free-falling test masses**|M Armano et.al.|[2407.04427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04427v1)|null|LISA Pathfinder was a mission designed to test key technologies required for gravitational wave detection in space. Magnetically driven forces play a key role in the instrument sensitivity in the low-frequency regime, which corresponds to the measurement band of interest for future space-borne gravitational wave observatories. Magnetic-induced forces couple to the test mass motion, introducing a contribution to the relative acceleration noise between the free falling test masses. In this Letter we present the first complete estimate of this term of the instrument performance model. Our results set the magnetic-induced acceleration noise during the February 2017 noise run of $\rm 0.25_{-0.08}^{+0.15}\,fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1 mHz and $\rm 1.01_{-0.24}^{+0.73}\, fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss how the non-stationarities of the interplanetary magnetic field can affect these values during extreme space weather conditions.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Recollements for graded gentle algebras from spherical band objects**|Pierre Bodin et.al.|[2407.04374v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04374v1)|null|In this paper we study the localization of a derived category of a graded gentle algebra by a subcategory generated by a spherical band object. This object corresponds to a simple closed curve under the equivalence between the perfect derived category of the graded gentle algebra and the partially wrapped Fukaya category of the associated graded marked surface, as established by Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich.   We describe this localization as a recollement that involves the derived category of a new graded algebra given by quiver and relations. This leads us to the introduction of the class of graded pinched gentle algebras, a generalization of graded gentle algebras. We then show that these algebras are in bijection with graded marked surfaces with conical singularities. Moreover, under this correspondence the localization process amounts to the contraction of the closed curve.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Transmission spectroscopy of CF$_4$ molecules in intense x-ray fields**|Rui Jin et.al.|[2407.04303v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04303v1)|null|The nonlinear interaction of x-rays with matter is at the heart of understanding and controlling ultrafast molecular dynamics from an atom-specific viewpoint, providing new scientific and analytical opportunities to explore the structure and dynamics of small quantum systems. At increasingly high x-ray intensity, the sensitivity of ultrashort x-ray pulses to specific electronic states and emerging short-lived transient intermediates is of particular relevance for our understanding of fundamental multi-photon absorption processes. In this work, intense x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses at the European XFEL (EuXFEL) are combined with a gas cell and grating spectrometer for a high-intensity transmission spectroscopy study of multiphoton-induced ultrafast molecular fragmentation dynamics in CF$_4$. This approach unlocks the direct intra-pulse observation of transient fragments, including neutral atoms, by their characteristic absorption lines in the transmitted broad-band x-ray spectrum. The dynamics with and without initially producing fluorine K-shell holes are studied by tuning the central photon energy. The absorption spectra are measured at different FEL intensities to observe nonlinear effects. Transient isolated fluorine atoms and ions are spectroscopically recorded within the ultrashort pulse duration of few tens of femtoseconds. An isosbestic point that signifies the correlated transition between intact neutral CF$_4$ molecules and charged atomic fragments is observed near the fluorine K-edge. The dissociation dynamics and the multiphoton absorption-induced dynamics encoded in the spectra are theoretically interpreted. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of high-intensity x-ray transmission spectroscopy to study ultrafast molecular dynamics with sensitivity to specific intermediate species and their electronic structure.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Electronic Correlations in Multielectron Silicon Quantum Dots**|Dylan H. Liang et.al.|[2407.04289v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04289v1)|null|Silicon quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize technology with capabilities to solve real-life problems that are computationally complex or even intractable for modern computers [1] by offering sufficient high quality qubits to perform complex error-corrected calculations. Silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor based quantum dots present a promising pathway for realizing practical quantum computers. To improve certain qubit properties, it is a common strategy to incorporate multiple electrons in the same dot in order to form qubits in higher confined orbital states. Theoretical modelling is an essential part of understanding the quantum behaviour of these electrons, providing a basis for validating the physical working of device models as well as providing insights into experimental data.   Hartree-Fock theory is an imperative tool for the electronic structure modelling of multi-electron quantum dots due to its ability to simulate a large number of electrons with manageable computation load. However, an efficient calculation of the self-consistent field becomes hard because dot formations in silicon are characterized by strong electron-electron interactions and conduction band valleys, besides the relatively high comparative effective mass, which add to create a behaviour dominated by repulsion between electrons rather than a well established shell structure. In this paper, we present a Hartree-Fock-based method that accounts for these complexities for the modelling of silicon quantum dots. With this method, we first establish the significance of including electron-electron interactions and valley degree of freedom and their implications. We then explore a simple case of anisotropic dots and observe the impact of anisotropy on dot formations.|
|**2024-07-05**|**An Edge-on Regular Disk Galaxy at z=5.289**|Haojing Yan et.al.|[2407.04209v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04209v1)|null|While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z~7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z>3, with some being candidates at z>7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. To date, there is only one confirmed case at z>5 ("Twister-z5") reported in the literature. Here we present D-CEERS-z5289, a stellar disk at $z=5.289\pm0.001$ discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} Msun. Its age is in the range of 330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 Msun/yr. It is conceivable that this galaxy assembled its stellar mass by secular growth. Unfortunately, the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve. Nevertheless, the width of its H$\alpha$ line (~345 km/s) from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk suggests that it could be a fast-rotating system.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration**|Allan Xi Chen et.al.|[2407.04197v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197v1)|null|We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Hadronuclear interactions in AGN jets as the origin of the diffuse high-energy neutrino background**|Rui Xue et.al.|[2407.04195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04195v1)|null|The origin of diffuse high-energy neutrinos from TeV to PeV energies detected by IceCube Observatory remains a mystery. In our previous work, we have shown that hadronuclear (p-p) interactions in AGN jets could be important and generate detectable very-high-energy emissions. Here, we further explore these interactions in the AGN jets based on their luminosity function. The diffuse neutrino flux and corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux have been calculated and compared with observational data. In our modeling, two beaming patterns are considered separately. To make sure that the corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux does not overshoot the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background, we find that if the neutrino production region in jet is opaque to $\gamma$ rays, p-p interactions in AGN jets with a small viewing angle (the blazar case) are able to interpret the PeV neutrino background. Similarly, AGN jets with a large viewing angle (the radio galaxy case) may interpret the TeV neutrino background. While, if the neutrino production region is transparent to $\gamma$ rays, only blazars have the potential to interpret the DNB around PeV band. Some caveats are also discussed.|

Taras et.al.|[2407.04187v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04187v1)|null|The Asgard instrument suite proposed for the ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) brings with it a new generation of instruments for spectroscopy and nulling. Asgard will enable investigations such as measurement of direct stellar masses for Galactic archaeology and direct detection of giant exoplanets to probe formation models using the first nulling interferometer in the southern hemisphere. We present the design and implementation of the Astralis-built Heimdallr, the beam combiner for fringe tracking and stellar interferometry in K band, as well as Solarstein, a novel implementation of a 4-beam telescope simulator for alignment and calibration. In this update, we verify that the Heimdallr design is sufficient to perform diffraction-limited beam combination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Solarstein presents an interface comparable to the VLTI with co-phased, equal intensity beams, enabling alignment and calibration for all Asgard instruments. In doing so, we share techniques for aligning and implementing large instruments in bulk optics.|

Cologgi et.al.|[2407.04136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04136v1)|null|The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter.

CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is approved for a Phase B study. In this work, we report on the characterization of the Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) that will be used as readout sensors of the absorption stage of the Compton polarimeter. We assessed the APDs gain and energy resolution as a function of temperature by irradiating the sensor with a \textsuperscript{55}Fe radioactive source. Moreover, the APDs were also characterized as being coupled to a GAGG scintillator.|

|**2024-07-04**|**Multi-wavelength properties of three new radio-powerful $z\sim5.6$ QSOs discovered from RACS**|L. Ighina et.al.|[2407.04094v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04094v1)|null|We present a multi-wavelength study on three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi stellar objects (QSOs) selected based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties in publicly available surveys and then identified with dedicated spectroscopic observations. These are among the radio-brightest QSOs currently known at $z>5.5$, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}>100$. In this work we present their identification and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on the detection in public surveys as well as dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties, in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in order to accurately characterise these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source, at $z=5.61$, that presents clear blazars properties (strong and flat radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model, as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and the accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.2$. With this work we increase the number of very-high redshift radio-powerful QSOs characterised with multi-wavelength observations, essential in order to understand the evolution and the properties of this still poorly constrained class of sources.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Silkscreen: Direct Measurements of Galaxy Distances from Survey Image Cutouts**|Tim B. Miller et.al.|[2407.04091v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04091v1)|null|With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Traditional techniques such as tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce Silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network to extract summary statistics from the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 < D ({\rm Mpc)} < 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of amortized inference. For surveys like LSST, Silkscreen, once amortized, will facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. While we focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Rethinking the fundamental performance limits of integrated sensing and communication systems**|Zhouyuan Yu et.al.|[2407.03926v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03926v1)|null|Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as a key enabler and feature of future wireless networks. In the existing works analyzing the performances of ISAC, discrete-time systems were commonly assumed, which, however, overlooked the impacts of temporal, spectral, and spatial properties. To address this issue, we establish a unified information model for the band-limited continuous-time ISAC systems. In the established information model, we employ a novel sensing performance metric, called the sensing mutual information (SMI). Through analysis, we show how the SMI can be utilized as a bridge between the mutual information domain and the mean squared error (MSE) domain. In addition, we illustrate the communication mutual information (CMI)-SMI and CMI-MSE regions to identify the performance bounds of ISAC systems in practical settings and reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing performances. Moreover, via analysis and numerical results, we provide two valuable insights into the design of novel ISAC-enabled systems: i) communication prefers the waveforms of random amplitude, sensing prefers the waveforms of constant amplitude, both communication and sensing favor the waveforms of low correlations with random phases; ii) There exists a linear positive proportional relationship between the allocated time-frequency resource and the achieved communication rate/sensing MSE.|
|**2024-07-04**|**Force-Matching Based Polarizable and Non-Polarizable Force Fields for Perovskite and Non-Perovskite Phases of CsPbI$_3$**|C. Vona et.al.|[2407.03874v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03874v1)|null|Lead halide perovskites have emerged as highly efficient solar cell materials. However, to date, the most promising members of this class are polymorphs, in which a wide-band gap $\delta$ phase competes with the photoactive perovskite $\alpha$ form, and the intrinsic physical interactions that stabilize one phase over the other are currently not well understood. Classical molecular dynamics simulations based on suitably parameterized force fields (FF) enable computational studies over broad temperature (and pressure) ranges and can help to identify the underlying factors that govern relative phase stability at the atomic level. In this article, we present a polarizable (pol) as well as a non-polarizable (npol) FF for the all-inorganic lead halide material CsPbI$_3$ as a prototype system exhibiting a $\delta$/$\alpha$ polymorphism. Both npol and pol FFs have been determined using a force-matching approach based on reference data from first-principles molecular dynamics simulations over a wide range of temperatures. While both FFs are able to describe the perovskite as well as the non-perovskite phase, finer structural details as well as the relative phase stability are better reproduced with the polarizable version. A comparison of these ab initio-derived interatomic potentials allows direct insights into the physical origin of the interactions that govern the interplay between the two competing phases. It turns out that explicit polarization is the essential factor that stabilizes the strongly anisotropic $\delta$ phase over the high symmetry perovskite $\alpha$ phase at lower temperatures. This fundamental difference between $\alpha$ and $\delta$ phase appears universal and might thus also hold for other perovskite compounds with $\delta$/$\alpha$ polymorphism and thus provide rational guidance for synthetic efforts to stabilize the photoactive perovskite phase at room temperature.|

Here we report the realization of an exceptional line semimetal in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystal. A pair of exceptional rings with opposite topologies are connected by the drumhead bulk states in the first Brillouin zone. The exceptional rings not only possess wave-function topology and thus result in the drumhead surface states, but also host spectral topology and thereby give rise to the hybrid-order geometry-dependent skin effect in three dimensions. Our experimental results evidence the complete non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence of the three-dimensional exceptional line semimetal, and may pave the way for designing non-Hermitian acoustic devices.|

For example, large-scale fibre-based quantum networks will require QFC to interconnect heterogeneous building blocks like emitters, channels, memories and detectors. The performance of existing QFC devices - typically realised in periodically-poled nonlinear crystals - is often severely limited by parasitic noise that arises when the pump wavelength lies between the wavelengths which are inter-converted. Here we investigate the noise spectrum of a frequency converter pumped by a CW 1064 nm laser. The converter was realised as a monolithic bulk pump enhancement cavity made from a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (ppKTP) crystal - quasi-phase-matched for the conversion of 637 nm to 1587 nm. In the range from 1140 nm to 1330 nm (up to 60 THz from the pump) Stokes-Raman resonances can be identified as the dominant noise source while the noise in the range from 1330 nm to 1650 nm can be attributed mainly to parasitic spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Further, a succession of narrow-band peaks is observed in the spectrum originating from higher-order counter-propagating SPDC. Both types of counter-propagation, where either the lower-energy idler photon or the higher-energy signal photon counter-propagate relative to the pump beam, are observed, with narrow-band peaks corresponding to 10th to 44th order quasi-phase-matching.|
|**2024-07-04**|**On the nature of yrast states in neutron-rich polonium isotopes**|R. Lica et.al.|[2407.03839v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03839v1)|null|Polonium isotopes having two protons above the shell closure at $Z=82$ show a wide variety of low-lying high-spin isomeric states across the whole chain. The structure of neutron-deficient isotopes up to $^{210}$Po ($N=126$) is well established as they are easily produced through various methods. However, there is not much information available for the neutron-rich counterparts for which only selective techniques can be used for their production. We report on the first fast-timing measurements of yrast states up to the 8$^+$ level in $^{214,216,218}$Po isotopes produced in the $\beta^-$ decay of $^{214,216,218}$Bi at ISOLDE, CERN. In particular, our new half-life value of 607(14) ps for the 8$_1^+$ state in $^{214}$Po is nearly 20 times shorter than the one available in literature and comparable with the newly measured half-lives of 409(16) and 628(25) ps for the corresponding 8$_1^+$ states in $^{216,218}$Po, respectively. The measured $B(E2;8_1^+ \to 6_1^+)$ transition probability values follow an increasing trend relative to isotope mass, reaching a maximum for $^{216}$Po. The increase contradicts the previous claims of isomerism for the $8^+$ yrast states in neutron-rich $^{214}$Po and beyond. Together with the other measured yrast transitions, the $B(E2)$ values provide a crucial test of the different theoretical approaches describing the underlying configurations of the yrast band. The new experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations using the KHPE and H208 effective interactions and their pairing modified versions, showing an increase in configuration mixing when moving towards the heavier isotopes.|

Deltuva et.al.|[2407.03800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03800v1)|null|The $^{12}$C(p,2p)$^{11}$B reaction at $E_p =98.7$ MeV proton beam energy is analyzed using a rigorous three-particle scattering formalism extended to include the internal excitation of the nuclear core or residual nucleus. The excitation proceeds via the core interaction with any of the external nucleons. We assume the $^{11}$B ground and low-lying excited states [$\frac32^-$ (0.0 MeV), $\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV), $\frac72^-$ (6.74 MeV)] and the excited states [$\frac12^-$ (2.12 MeV), $\frac32^-$ (5.02 MeV)] to be members of $K=\frac32^-$ and $K=\frac12^-$ rotational bands, respectively. The dynamical core excitation results in a significant cross section for the reaction leading to the $\frac52^-$ (4.45 MeV) excited state of $^{11}$B that cannot be populated through the single-particle excitation mechanism. The detailed agreement between the theoretical calculations and data depends on the used optical model parametrizations and the kinematical configuration of the detected nucleons.|

In bulk TMD, band dispersions are observed in the direction normal to the sheet plane (z-direction) due to the hybridization of out-of-plane orbitals but no kz-dispersion is expected at the single-layer limit. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we precisely address the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover of the electronic band structure of epitaxial WSe$_2$ thin films. Increasing number of discrete electronic states appears in given kz-ranges while increasing the number of layers. The continuous bulk dispersion is nearly retrieved for 6-sheet films. These results are reproduced by calculations going from a relatively simple tight-binding model to a sophisticated KKR-Green's function calculation. This two-dimensional system is hence used as a benchmark to compare different theoretical approaches.|

Renzini et.al.|[2407.03742v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03742v1)|null|The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has announced the detection of almost 100 binary black holes so far, which have been used in several studies to infer the features of the underlying binary black hole population. From these, it is possible to predict the overall gravitational-wave (GW) fractional energy density contributed by black holes throughout the Universe, and thus estimate the gravitational-wave background (GWB) spectrum emitted in the current GW detector band. These predictions are fundamental in our forecasts for background detection and characterization, with both present and future instruments. The uncertainties in the inferred population strongly impact the predicted energy spectrum, and in this paper we present a new, flexible method to quickly calculate the energy spectrum for varying black hole population features such as the mass spectrum and redshift distribution. We implement this method in an open-access package, popstock, and extensively test its capabilities. Using popstock, we investigate how uncertainties in these distributions impact our detection capabilities and present several caveats for background estimation. In particular, we find that the standard assumption that the background signal follows a 2/3 power-law at low frequencies is both waveform and mass-model dependent, and that the signal power-law is likely shallower than previously modelled, given the current waveform and population knowledge.|

The particles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials, exhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N) phases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large, respectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by their competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The finite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase not found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the transition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical endpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find that it captures the incoherent transport of the system. The conductivity derived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a strong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large conductivity at the NI crossover recently found in TTF-CA.|

Simons et.al.|[2407.03505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03505v1)|null|The supersolid phase of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate has an intriguing excitation spectrum displaying a band structure. Here, the dressing of an impurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the supersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is calculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate results for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fr\"ohlich approximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase transition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that for strong impurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single droplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.|

We investigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several members of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of the AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard exchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation and that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter describes these states better. For $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$, the AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$, only by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and the CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural optimization, whose stability among different \textit{X} shows the tendency consistent with experiments.|
