Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.|

Our research focuses on the development of non-invasive techniques based on the Object Detection (OD) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and verify the proper use of various types of PPE such as helmets, safety glasses, masks, and protective clothing. This study proposes the SH17 Dataset, consisting of 8,099 annotated images containing 75,994 instances of 17 classes collected from diverse industrial environments, to train and validate the OD models. We have trained state-of-the-art OD models for benchmarking, and initial results demonstrate promising accuracy levels with You Only Look Once (YOLO)v9-e model variant exceeding 70.9% in PPE detection. The performance of the model validation on cross-domain datasets suggests that integrating these technologies can significantly improve safety management systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for industries striving to meet human safety regulations and protect their workforce. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ahmadmughees/sh17dataset.|

Unlike Centralized FL, Decentralized FL (DFL) employs a network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server, allowing direct communication among clients and leading to significant communication resource savings. However, due to data heterogeneity, not all neighboring nodes contribute to enhancing the local client's model performance. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\emph{AFIND+}}, a simple yet efficient algorithm for sampling and aggregating neighbors in DFL, with the aim of leveraging collaboration to improve clients' model performance. AFIND+ identifies helpful neighbors, adaptively adjusts the number of selected neighbors, and strategically aggregates the sampled neighbors' models based on their contributions. Numerical results on real-world datasets with diverse data partitions demonstrate that AFIND+ outperforms other sampling algorithms in DFL and is compatible with most existing DFL optimization algorithms.|

Recent studies have identified transient interpenetration of the long-chain rings contributing to dynamic arrest on the center-of-mass level. Interpenetration of rings is proposed as an approach to facilitate glass formation in polymer melts. In this work, inspired by recent advances in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers, we investigate glass transition on the nanometer-scale segments influenced by permanent interpenetration of rings using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that decreasing chain length in the mechanically interlocked system is equivalent to inducing an effective chain stiffness on the sub-rings. The induced stiffness provides a unified explanation for these unique structural features and transient dynamic arrest in the system of interlocked rings with rather short chains. Further, a crossover is observed in the scaling relation between localization and glassy depth upon cooling. Our work reveals a dynamic transition from weak to strong caging at the crossover temperature. According to the localization model, we demonstrate that the chain stiffness increases the critical temperature and oscillation distance, therefore leads to more fragile dynamics and deeper glassy state. These findings are consistent with the predictions of molecular simulations and theories for polymers with real local stiffness. Our work deepens the understanding of the role of induced stiffness on glass transition, and opens up a new direction to design rich glass materials by manipulating stiffness through mechanical bonds.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Effective Targeted Testing of Smart Contracts**|Mahdi Fooladgar et.al.|[2407.04250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04250v1)|null|Smart contracts are autonomous and immutable pieces of code that are deployed on blockchain networks and run by miners. They were first introduced by Ethereum in 2014 and have since been used for various applications such as security tokens, voting, gambling, non-fungible tokens, self-sovereign identities, stock taking, decentralized finances, decentralized exchanges, and atomic swaps. Since smart contracts are immutable, their bugs cannot be fixed, which may lead to significant monetary losses. While many researchers have focused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap between test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in both fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a targeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data. This tool can be used in diverse applications, such as killing the survived mutants in mutation testing, validating static analysis alarms, creating counter-examples for safety conditions, and reaching manually selected lines of code. This paper discusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic execution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us to propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart contracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom heuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a target line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution time. We conducted experiments involving an extensive set of smart contracts, target lines, and safety conditions based on real-world faults and test suites from related tools. The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Griffin can effectively identify the required test data within a reasonable timeframe.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Smart Vision-Language Reasoners**|Denisa Roberts et.al.|[2407.04212v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04212v1)|[link](https://github.com/smarter-vlm/smarter)|In this article, we investigate vision-language models (VLM) as reasoners. The ability to form abstractions underlies mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and other Math AI tasks. Several formalisms have been given to these underlying abstractions and skills utilized by humans and intelligent systems for reasoning. Furthermore, human reasoning is inherently multimodal, and as such, we focus our investigations on multimodal AI. In this article, we employ the abstractions given in the SMART task (Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task) introduced in \cite{cherian2022deep} as meta-reasoning and problem-solving skills along eight axes: math, counting, path, measure, logic, spatial, and pattern. We investigate the ability of vision-language models to reason along these axes and seek avenues of improvement. Including composite representations with vision-language cross-attention enabled learning multimodal representations adaptively from fused frozen pretrained backbones for better visual grounding. Furthermore, proper hyperparameter and other training choices led to strong improvements (up to $48\%$ gain in accuracy) on the SMART task, further underscoring the power of deep multimodal learning. The smartest VLM, which includes a novel QF multimodal layer, improves upon the best previous baselines in every one of the eight fundamental reasoning skills.

|**2024-07-04**|**DASS: Distilled Audio State Space Models Are Stronger and More Duration-Scalable Learners**|Saurabhchand Bhati et.al.|[2407.04082v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04082v1)|null|State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an alternative to Transformers for audio modeling due to their high computational efficiency with long inputs. While recent efforts on Audio SSMs have reported encouraging results, two main limitations remain: First, in 10-second short audio tagging tasks, Audio SSMs still underperform compared to Transformer-based models such as Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). Second, although Audio SSMs theoretically support long audio inputs, their actual performance with long audio has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address these limitations, in this paper, 1) We applied knowledge distillation in audio space model training, resulting in a model called Knowledge Distilled Audio SSM (DASS). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first SSM that outperforms the Transformers on AudioSet and achieves an mAP of 47.6; and 2) We designed a new test called Audio Needle In A Haystack (Audio NIAH). We find that DASS, trained with only 10-second audio clips, can retrieve sound events in audio recordings up to 2.5 hours long, while the AST model fails when the input is just 50 seconds, demonstrating SSMs are indeed more duration scalable.|

When $\sigma<0$, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the superfluid and the localized phase is driven by the long-range correlations and the Luttinger parameter $K$ takes the critical value $K_c(\sigma)=3/2-\sigma/2$. The localized phase is a Bose glass for $\sigma>\sigma_c=3-\pi^2/3\simeq -0.289868$, and a Mott glass -- characterized by a vanishing compressibility and a gapless conductivity -- when $\sigma<\sigma_c$. Our conclusions, based on the nonperturbative functional renormalization group and perturbative renormalization group, are confirmed by the study of the case $\sigma=-1$, corresponding to a perfectly correlated disorder in space, where the model is exactly solvable in the semiclassical limit $K\to 0^+$.|

Using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, the system can recognize attributes such as upper body color, what the person is wearing, accessories they are wearing, headgear, etc., and analyze behavior through cameras installed around the city.|

It adjusts the proposal distribution of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to maximize the sampling efficiency, using a formalism inspired by reinforcement learning. In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising for instance both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model. We discuss the current limitations of the method and suggest possible ways to improve it.|
|**2024-07-03**|**Anomaly-based Framework for Detecting Power Overloading Cyberattacks in Smart Grid AMI**|Abdelaziz Amara Korba et.al.|[2407.03264v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03264v1)|null|The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components of the smart grid. It provides interactive services for managing billing and electricity consumption, but it also introduces new vectors for cyberattacks. Although, the devastating and severe impact of power overloading cyberattacks on smart grid AMI, few researches in the literature have addressed them. In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.|

We make his discussion mathematically rigorous, keeping it elementary, using his other idea. The resulting model leads to accurate quantitative results and allows us to derive a well-known formula from optics. In the process, we get acquainted with mathematical tools such as Smirnov's fermionic observables, transfer matrices, and spectral radii. Quantum walks and the six-vertex model arise as the next step in this direction.|
|**2024-07-03**|**FedPot: A Quality-Aware Collaborative and Incentivized Honeypot-Based Detector for Smart Grid Networks**|Abdullatif Albaseer et.al.|[2407.02845v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02845v1)|null|Honeypot technologies provide an effective defense strategy for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), particularly in enhancing the Advanced Metering Infrastructure's (AMI) security by bolstering the network intrusion detection system. For this security paradigm to be fully realized, it necessitates the active participation of small-scale power suppliers (SPSs) in implementing honeypots and engaging in collaborative data sharing with traditional power retailers (TPRs). To motivate this interaction, TPRs incentivize data sharing with tangible rewards. However, without access to an SPS's confidential data, it is daunting for TPRs to validate shared data, thereby risking SPSs' privacy and increasing sharing costs due to voluminous honeypot logs. These challenges can be resolved by utilizing Federated Learning (FL), a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows for model training without data relocation. However, the conventional FL algorithm lacks the requisite functionality for both the security defense model and the rewards system of the AMI network. This work presents two solutions: first, an enhanced and cost-efficient FedAvg algorithm incorporating a novel data quality measure, and second, FedPot, the development of an effective security model with a fair incentives mechanism under an FL architecture. Accordingly, SPSs are limited to sharing the ML model they learn after efficiently measuring their local data quality, whereas TPRs can verify the participants' uploaded models and fairly compensate each participant for their contributions through rewards. Simulation results, drawn from realistic mircorgrid network log datasets, demonstrate that the proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art techniques by enhancing the security model and guaranteeing fair reward distributions.|

Probabilistic Reservoir Computing (RC) is well-suited for long-term chaotic predictions by handling complex dynamic systems. Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) devices in spintronics, with their nonlinear and probabilistic operations, can enhance performance in these tasks. This study proposes an RC system utilizing SOT devices for predicting chaotic dynamics. By simulating the reservoir in an RC network with SOT devices that achieve nonlinear resistance changes with random distribution, we enhance the robustness for the predictive capability of the model. The RC network predicted the behaviors of the Mackey-Glass and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating that stochastic SOT devices significantly improve long-term prediction accuracy.|
|**2024-07-02**|**Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture**|Itamar Kolvin et.al.|[2407.02347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02347v1)|null|Are heterogeneous materials harder to break than homogeneous ones? Predicting rapid crack propagation in the presence of inhomogeneities remains a challenge. Linear perturbations leave the net speed of fracture unchanged. We obtain a nonlinear equation of motion for planar crack fronts to gain insight into the dynamic fracture of moderately heterogeneous solids. The coupling of the front geometry to the heterogeneity landscape renormalizes the energy dissipation and the crack velocity. In materials whose toughness is weakly sensitive to crack speed, such as silica glass, heterogeneity results in increased dissipation and slower crack propagation. However, heterogeneity has a reduced effect and may even facilitate fracture in strongly velocity-dependent materials.|

In this work, we present a new dataset, called VRBiom, of periocular videos acquired using a Virtual Reality headset. The VRBiom, targeted at biometric applications, consists of 900 short videos acquired from 25 individuals recorded in the NIR spectrum. These 10s long videos have been captured using the internal tracking cameras of Meta Quest Pro at 72 FPS. To encompass real-world variations, the dataset includes recordings under three gaze conditions: steady, moving, and partially closed eyes. We have also ensured an equal split of recordings without and with glasses to facilitate the analysis of eye-wear. These videos, characterized by non-frontal views of the eye and relatively low spatial resolutions (400 x 400), can be instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art research across various biometric applications. The VRBiom dataset can be utilized to evaluate, train, or adapt models for biometric use-cases such as iris and/or periocular recognition and associated sub-tasks such as detection and semantic segmentation.   In addition to data from real individuals, we have included around 1100 PA constructed from 92 PA instruments. These PAIs fall into six categories constructed through combinations of print attacks (real and synthetic identities), fake 3D eyeballs, plastic eyes, and various types of masks and mannequins. These PA videos, combined with genuine (bona-fide) data, can be utilized to address concerns related to spoofing, which is a significant threat if these devices are to be used for authentication.   The VRBiom dataset is publicly available for research purposes related to biometric applications only.|
|**2024-07-02**|**Magnetic critical phenomena and low temperature re-entrant spin-glass features of Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy**|Abhinav Kumar Khorwal et.al.|[2407.02149v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02149v1)|null|A detailed investigation of the structural and magnetic properties, including magnetocaloric effect, re-entrant spin-glass behavior at low temperature, and critical behavior in polycrystalline Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy is reported. The prepared alloy crystallizes in a cubic CsCl-type crystal structure with Pm-3m space group. The temperature-dependent magnetization data reveals a second-order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition ($\sim$ 122.9 K), which is further supported by the analysis of the magnetocaloric effect. The isothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the studied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange interactions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the critical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic susceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\delta$ = 4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type ferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with distance as J(r) $\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the AC susceptibility data suggests that the frequency-dependent shifting of the peak temperatures is well explained using standard dynamic scaling laws such as the critical slowing down model and Vogel-Fulcher law, and confirms the signature of re-entrant spin-glass features in Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy. Furthermore, maximum magnetic entropy change of $\sim$ 1.92 J/kg-K and relative cooling power of $\sim$ 496 J/kg at 50 kOe applied magnetic field are determined from magnetocaloric studies that are comparable to those of other Mn-Fe-Al systems.|

In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.|

The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most popular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences might be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from this survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are interested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity visualization on smartwatches.|
|**2024-07-02**|**Universal mechanism of shear thinning in supercooled liquids**|Hideyuki Mizuno et.al.|[2407.01880v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01880v1)|null|Soft glassy materials experience a significant reduction in viscosity $\eta$ when subjected to shear flow, known as shear thinning. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law scaling of $\eta$ with the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$, $\eta \propto \dot{\gamma}^{-\nu}$, where the exponent $\nu$ is typically around $0.7$ to $0.8$ across different materials. Two decades ago, the mode coupling theory (MCT) suggested that shear thinning occurs due to the advection. However, it predicts too large $\nu = 1$ (> $0.7$ to $0.8$) and overestimates the onset shear rate by orders of magnitude. Recently, it was claimed that a minute distortion of the particle configuration is responsible for shear thinning. Here we extend the MCT to include the distortion, and find that both advection and distortion contribute to shear thinning, but the latter is dominant. Our formulation works quantitatively for several different glass formers. We explain why shear thinning is universal for many glassy materials.|
|**2024-07-01**|**Immutable in Principle, Upgradeable by Design: Exploratory Study of Smart Contract Upgradeability**|Ilham Qasse et.al.|[2407.01493v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01493v1)|null|Smart contracts, known for their immutable nature to ensure trust via automated enforcement, have evolved to require upgradeability due to unforeseen vulnerabilities and the need for feature enhancements post-deployment. This contradiction between immutability and the need for modifications has led to the development of upgradeable smart contracts. These contracts are immutable in principle yet upgradable by design, allowing updates without altering the underlying data or state, thus preserving the contract's intent while allowing improvements. This study aims to understand the application and implications of upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By introducing a dataset that catalogs the versions and evolutionary trajectories of smart contracts, the research explores key dimensions: the prevalence and adoption patterns of upgrade mechanisms, the likelihood and occurrences of contract upgrades, the nature of modifications post-upgrade, and their impact on user engagement and contract activity. Through empirical analysis, this study identifies upgradeable contracts and examines their upgrade history to uncover trends, preferences, and challenges associated with modifications. The evidence from analyzing over 44 million contracts shows that only 3% have upgradeable characteristics, with only 0.34% undergoing upgrades. This finding underscores a cautious approach by developers towards modifications, possibly due to the complexity of upgrade processes or a preference for maintaining stability. Furthermore, the study shows that upgrades are mainly aimed at feature enhancement and vulnerability mitigation, particularly when the contracts' source codes are accessible. However, the relationship between upgrades and user activity is complex, suggesting that additional factors significantly affect the use of smart contracts beyond their evolution.|

The material behaviour is described by a modified power law model, which is characterized by only four parameters, the glassy and rubbery elastic moduli, a characteristic exponent n and a timescale ${\tau}_0$. The maximum adherence force that can be reached while unloading the rigid indenter from a relaxed viscoelastic half-space is studied by means of a numerical implementation based on the boundary element method, as a function of the unloading velocity, preload and by varying the broadness of the viscoelastic material spectrum. Through a comprehensive numerical analysis we have determined the minimum contact radius that is needed to achieve the maximum amplification of the pull-off force at a specified unloading rate and for different material exponents n. The numerical results are then compared with the prediction of Persson and Brener viscoelastic crack propagation theory, providing excellent agreement. However, comparison against experimental tests for a glass lens indenting a PDMS substrate show data can be fitted with the linear theory only up to an unloading rate of about $100 \textrm{ $\mu$}$m/s showing the fracture process zone rate-dependent contribution to the energy enhancement is of the same order of the bulk dissipation contribution. Hence, the limitations of the current numerical and theoretical models for viscoelastic adhesion are discussed in light of the most recent literature results.|

At its core, it is about building software that is secure in composition with untrusted code, a challenge that extends far beyond blockchains. We introduce SCIF, a language for building smart contracts that are compositionally secure. SCIF is based on the fundamentally compositional principle of secure information flow, but extends this core mechanism to include protection against reentrancy attacks, confused deputy attacks, and improper error handling, even in the presence of malicious contracts that do not follow SCIF's rules. SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We describe the SCIF language, including its static checking rules and runtime. Finally, we implement several applications with intricate security reasoning, showing how SCIF supports building complex smart contracts securely and gives programmer accurate diagnostics about potential security bugs.|

Spin glasses and other frustrated systems are not among them as the clusters of aligned spins usually considered in this context start to percolate in the disordered phase and hence fail to indicate the onset of ordering. In this mini-review we provide an overview of the state of the art in this field, including recent advances, and outline the main open questions in the area.|

Addressing a pressing issue in the digital age, we investigate public reactions to AI-created fabrications through a structured experiment on a simulated academic conference platform. Our findings indicate a profound public challenge in discerning such content, highlighted by GAI's capacity for realistic fabrications. To counter this, we introduce an innovative approach employing large language models like ChatGPT for truthfulness assess-ment. We detail a specific workflow for scrutinizing the authenticity of everyday digital content, aimed at boosting public awareness and capability in identifying fake mate-rials. We apply this workflow to an agent bot on Telegram to help users identify the authenticity of text content through conversations. Our project encapsulates a two-pronged strategy: generating fake content to understand its dynamics and developing assessment techniques to mitigate its impact. As part of that effort we propose the creation of speculative fact-checking wearables in the shape of reading glasses and a clip-on. As a computational media art initiative, this project under-scores the delicate interplay between technological progress, ethical consid-erations, and societal consciousness.|

We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g')^{O(1)}$, where $g'$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; moreover, for certain $A$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.|

Applying artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast or simulate key events in clinical trials holds great potential for providing insights to guide trial designs. However, complex data collection and question definition requiring medical expertise and a deep understanding of trial designs have hindered the involvement of AI thus far. This paper tackles these challenges by presenting a comprehensive suite of meticulously curated AIready datasets covering multi-modal data (e.g., drug molecule, disease code, text, categorical/numerical features) and 8 crucial prediction challenges in clinical trial design, encompassing prediction of trial duration, patient dropout rate, serious adverse event, mortality rate, trial approval outcome, trial failure reason, drug dose finding, design of eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we provide basic validation methods for each task to ensure the datasets' usability and reliability. We anticipate that the availability of such open-access datasets will catalyze the development of advanced AI approaches for clinical trial design, ultimately advancing clinical trial research and accelerating medical solution development.

Zirconia thin films are of significant technological importance due to their remarkable electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, as well as their high melting temperature of 2715{\deg}C, which makes them increasingly attractive for various applications. In this study, ZrO2 thin films were deposited for 3 minutes, followed by the deposition of Pt-Ag/Pt onto the fabricated zirconia thin films, with deposition times ranging from 15 to 60 seconds. The varying deposition times of Pt-Ag/Pt influenced the optical and electronic properties of the thin films due to alterations in their surface roughness. The characteristics of the grown zirconia and Pt/Ag-Pt sputtered zirconia nanostructures were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical transmittance of these thin films was examined across the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. The investigation revealed various properties, such as enhanced photoluminescence and the emergence of new peaks in the visible range spectra. Plasmonic peaks were induced, and an increase in the sharpness of these peaks was observed between 403.15 nm and 512.10 nm for the Pt/Ag-Pt deposited samples. This enhancement in photoluminescence is attributed to the plasmonic properties of Pt-Ag nanoparticles on the zirconia thin film. The study demonstrates that these optically tuned thin film coatings, with their enhanced photoluminescence properties, can significantly improve the heat-resistance capacity of devices, mitigating issues related to overheating and device shutdown.|
