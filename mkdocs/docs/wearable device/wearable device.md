This field is vexed by the interplay of disorder, correlations and long-range order, whose properties are challenging to control and disentangle. We study the entropy-carrying excitations of a leading candidate in this search, the material NaYbSe$_2$, as a function of site dilution to directly address this challenge. We map the evolution of the entangled spins across the percolation transition, showing unequivocal evidence for the presence of an energy gap in the excitations of the system. However, we also show that this gap onsets at the percolation transition where disorder is the greatest, strongly suggesting that it is unlikely be associated with a quantum spin liquid. Instead we suggest the more universal scenario of a short-range ordered state with entropy-carrying boundaries.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Discovering Local Hidden-Variable Models for Arbitrary Multipartite Entangled States and Arbitrary Measurements**|Nick von Selzam et.al.|[2407.04673v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04673v1)|null|Measurement correlations in quantum systems can exhibit non-local behavior, a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics with applications such as device-independent quantum information processing. However, the explicit construction of local hidden-variable (LHV) models remains an outstanding challenge in the general setting. To address this, we develop an approach that employs gradient-descent algorithms from machine learning to find LHV models which reproduce the statistics of arbitrary measurements for quantum many-body states. In contrast to previous approaches, our method employs a general ansatz, enabling it to discover an LHV model in all cases where the state is local. Therefore, it provides actual estimates for the critical noise levels at which two-qubit Werner states and three-qubit GHZ and W states become non-local. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that two-spin subsystems in the ground states of translationally invariant Hamiltonians are local, while bigger subsystems are in general not. Our method now offers a quantitative tool for determining the regimes of non-locality in any given physical context, including scenarios involving non-equilibrium and decoherence.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Resistive switching suppression in metal/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ Schottky contacts prepared by room-temperature Pulsed Laser Deposition**|Renato Buzio et.al.|[2407.04671v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04671v1)|null|Deepening the understanding of interface-type Resistive Switching (RS) in metal/oxide heterojunctions is a key step for the development of high-performance memristors and Schottky rectifiers. In this study, we address the role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Ultrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal (001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by conventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly reversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization. Room-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier height $\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and ideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains almost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping and of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient air exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial homogeneity of $\phi_B$(<50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO mixed termination (|$\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|<35meV). Experimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD metallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This occurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to the creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas species affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows to rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure to ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.|

Bhupal Dev et.al.|[2407.04670v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04670v1)|null|We perform a comprehensive analysis of neutrinoless double beta decay and its interplay with low-energy flavor observables in a radiative neutrino mass model with scalar leptoquarks $S_1(\bar{3},1,1/3)$ and $\widetilde{R}_2(3,2,1/6)$. We carve out the parameter region consistent with constraints from neutrino mass and mixing, from collider searches, as well as from measurements of several flavor observables, including muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, charged lepton flavor violation and rare (semi)leptonic kaon and $B$-meson decays. We perform a global analysis to all existing constraints and show the (anti)correlations between all relevant Yukawa couplings satisfying these restrictions. We find that the most stringent constraint on the parameter space comes from $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei. We also point out a tension between the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and muon $(g-2)$ anomalies in this context. Taking benchmark points from these combined allowed regions, we study the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay including the canonical light neutrino and the leptoquark contributions. We find that for normal ordering of neutrino masses, the leptoquark contribution removes the cancellation region that occurs for the canonical case. The effective mass in presence of leptoquarks can lie in the desert region between the standard normal and inverted ordering cases, and this can be probed in future ton-scale experiments like LEGEND-1000 and nEXO. Taking suitable representative values of Yukawa couplings, we also obtain stringent constraints on leptoquark masses from different observables.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion**|Sarah N. Bentley et.al.|[2407.04669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669v1)|null|Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Edge-state transport in twisted bilayer graphene**|Jesús Arturo Sánchez-Sánchez et.al.|[2407.04668v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04668v1)|null|We investigate the electronic structure and transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) at a twist angle of $\theta\approx 1.696\text{{\deg}}$. Using a combination of molecular dynamics and tight-binding calculations, we find two superlattice gaps in the energy spectrum of the bulk, which emerge close to the Fermi level from the atomic rearrangement of the carbon atoms leading to a corrugation of the graphene sheets. Nanoribbons made from 1.696{\deg}-TBLG show edge-localized states inside the superlattice gaps. Applying the Green's function method, we demonstrate that the edge states carry electronic current with conductance values close to the conductance quantum. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, which is not due to one-way transport at the edges but due to the fact that these states are localized only at certain edges of the system, depending on how the nanoribbon has been cut from the bulk.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Efficient Materials Informatics between Rockets and Electrons**|Adam M. Krajewski et.al.|[2407.04648v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04648v1)|null|The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.   The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Quantized circular dichroism on the edge of quantum Hall systems: The many-body Chern number as seen from the edge**|F. Nur Ünal et.al.|[2407.04639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04639v1)|null|Quantum Hall states are characterized by a topological invariant, the many-body Chern number, which determines the quantized value of the Hall conductivity. Interestingly, this topological property can also be accessed through a dissipative response, by subjecting the system to a circular drive and comparing excitation rates obtained for opposite orientations of the drive. This quantized circular dichroism assumes that only the bulk contributes to the response. Indeed, in a confined and isolated system, the edge contribution exactly cancels the bulk response. This work explores an important corollary of the latter observation: If properly isolated, the circular dichroic response stemming from the edge of a quantum Hall droplet must be quantized, thus providing an appealing way to probe the many-body Chern number. Importantly, we demonstrate that this quantized edge response is entirely captured by low-energy chiral edge modes, allowing for a universal description of this effect based on Wen's edge theory. Its low-energy nature implies that the quantized edge response can be distinguished from the bulk response in the frequency domain. We illustrate our findings using realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulators, with different edge geometries, and propose detection schemes suitable for ultracold atoms. Edge dichroic responses emerge as a practical probe for strongly-correlated topological phases, accessible in cold-atom experiments.|

The integration of light emitting nanoparticle (NP) dopants, such as quantum dots (QDs) and rare-earth doped nanoparticles (RENPs), into a polymer resist would enable 3D printing of active polymer micro-photonic devices, including sensors, lasers, and solid-state displays. Many NPs are stabilized with oleic acid ligands to prevent degradation, but oleate-capped NPs (oc-NPs) tend to agglomerate in nonpolar media despite the hydrophobicity of the ligand. This results in an uneven distribution of NPs in polymers and increased optical extinction properties. In this work, we propose a general approach for dispersing various oc-NPs in commercial 3D printable polymers. We achieve controlled growth of small carbon chains around the oc-NPs by functionalizing the NPs with methyl-methacrylate monomers. The proposed approach is validated on RENPs (~65 nm) and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (~12 nm) using different commercial polymer resists (IP-Dip and IP-Visio). Dispersions of functionalized NPs (f-NPs) have improved NP density by an order of magnitude and are shown to be stable for several weeks with minimal impact on printing quality. Our approach is generalizable to a variety of oc-NPs and ultimately leads to higher quality polymer-based optical and electronic devices.|
|**2024-07-05**|**An autoencoder for compressing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data**|Steinn Ymir Agustsson et.al.|[2407.04631v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04631v1)|null|Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful experimental technique to determine the electronic structure of solids. Advances in light sources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data acquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most advanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast, effective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response to this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that efficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a large and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting standard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in $\mathbf{k}$. To test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare $k$-means clustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by discrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet data excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Protocol for scaling up a sign-ordered Kitaev chain without magnetic flux control**|Chun-Xiao Liu et.al.|[2407.04630v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04630v1)|null|Quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a new and promising material platform for realizing Kitaev chains with Majorana zero modes. So far, experiments have implemented a two-site chain with limited protection. We propose a protocol for scaling up the Kitaev chain that is accessible to current experiments and optimizes the Majorana protection. To this end, we make use of the fact that the relative sign of normal and superconducting hoppings mediated by an Andreev bound state can be changed by electrostatic gates. In this way, our method only relies on the use of individual electrostatic gates on hybrid regions, quantum dots, and tunnel barriers, respectively, without the need for individual magnetic flux control, greatly simplifying the device design. Our work provides guidance for realizing a topologically protected Kitaev chain, which is the building block of error-resilient topological quantum computation.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Median Mishaps between Chirality and Spin-Orbit Torques via Asymmetric Hysteresis**|Minhwan Kim et.al.|[2407.04624v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04624v1)|null|Averaged observations of physical phenomena have been utilized for comprehending specific occurrences in nature; however, these may overlook the crucial characteristics of individual events, thereby leading to diverse conclusions. For example, individual wave occurrences such as superposition and interference yield markedly divergent outcomes when viewed in detail. Similarly, this study enhances the comprehensive framework of spin-orbit torque (SOT) within the hysteresis loop shift measurement by employing the average of effective magnetic fields arising from two distinct magnetic reversals. This approach facilitates the presentation of a physically descriptive SOT model, previously characterized only by single chirality qualitatively. By integrating this model with established measurement methodologies and theoretical paradigms, we advance a theoretical framework based on the magnetic domain-wall chirality of individual polarizations and aim to elucidate the phenomena of SOT with clarity. The anticipated outcomes include the rectification of inaccuracies in widely employed measurement methodologies and the enhancement of our comprehension of the fundamental physics, which are expected to propel advancements in next-generation spintronics materials and devices.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Tunable kHz distributed feedback fiber laser enabled by glass additive-manufacturing**|Pawel Maniewski et.al.|[2407.04598v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04598v1)|null|For short sections of fibers tailored to a specific application, fast laser-based manufacturing techniques can be an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.|

Deep learning methods provide high-quality estimates of objective and subjective speech quality metrics. However, their significant computational requirements are often prohibitive on resource-constrained devices. To address this issue, we investigated binary activation maps (BAMs) for speech quality prediction on a convolutional architecture based on DNSMOS. We show that the binary activation model with quantization aware training matches the predictive performance of the baseline model. It further allows using other compression techniques. Combined with 8-bit weight quantization, our approach results in a 25-fold memory reduction during inference, while replacing almost all dot products with summations. Our findings show a path toward substantial resource savings by supporting mixed-precision binary multiplication in hard- and software.|
|**2024-07-05**|**A nonlinear room mode determines the operating conditions of a large-cavity synthetic jet actuator at low frequencies**|L. F. Olivera-Reyes et.al.|[2407.04574v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04574v1)|null|Synthetic Jet (SJ) actuators are an intrinsically complex combination of electronics, electric and mechanical systems. When studied theoretically, these elements are often simplified to coupled damped harmonic oscillators (DHO) that induce a pressure field within the cavity and drive momentum exchange. Thus, the performance of an SJ actuator results from coupling these DHOs, naturally leading to a few resonant modes. There is good evidence in the specialized literature of two resonant modes developing in SJ actuators: the membrane/piezoelectric mode and the Helmholtz resonance. In this work, we report on the effect of a third resonant mode that develops at very low frequencies due to a cavity much larger than the volume displaced by the actuator. We present evidence that the large-cavity dynamics determine the SJ performance in combination with the well-described formation criteria. We compare the intensity of this resonant mode with the first room modes using standard frequency analysis. Unlike typical room modes, the distribution of this resonant mode is very biased to lower frequencies. We also show that the resonant mode may be dimmed and focused by adding an obstacle in different cavity positions for the lower sound intensities. This mode overcomes the Helmholtz resonance, dominating the dynamics for higher sound intensities. We show that jet and vortex velocities mimic the sound pressure curve for the low-frequency range. Its effect mitigates for the higher range due to a delve through smaller stroke lengths, characterized as a fixed relation between the Reynolds and the Stokes numbers. We consider that the large-cavity dynamics is an additional element that, if integrated as design criteria, could extend the optimum frequency response of SJs.|

Despite the development of various ingestible antennas, there has been no comprehensive comparison of their performance as biosensors. This paper addresses this gap by examining and comparing the suitability of three common types of ingestible antennas -- dipole, patch, and loop -- as biosensors for distinguishing gastrointestinal tissues (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) based on their electromagnetic properties. The antennas studied in this work conform to the inner surface of biocompatible polylactic acid capsules with varying shell thicknesses and operate in the 433 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band. The comparison is performed in gastrointestinal tissues using several antenna parameters: 1) Sensing Capability: Changes in the phase of the reflection coefficient in the tissues are selected as the sensing parameter. 2) Robustness: The frequency interval (f_i) in which the antennas are matched (|S11| < -10 dB) in all the tissues and the maximum change in the center frequency (f_c) in different tissues are examined. 3) Radiation Performance: The gain and radiation efficiency of the antennas are examined. The effect of shell thickness on gain and radiation efficiency at 434 MHz is presented. Additionally, the radiation efficiency at various frequencies allocated for medical communications is compared with the theoretical maximum achievable efficiencies. These comprehensive data provide valuable information for making engineering decisions when designing multiplexed biosensor antennas for ingestible applications.|

We are developing a system that can identify and transform facial expressions into emojis to provide immediate feedback.The project consists of two components. Initially, we will employ sophisticated image processing techniques and neural networks to construct a deep learning model capable of precisely categorising facial expressions. Next, we will develop a basic application that records live video using the camera on your device. The app will utilise a sophisticated model to promptly analyse facial expressions and promptly exhibit corresponding emojis.Our objective is to develop a dynamic tool that integrates deep learning and real-time video processing for the purposes of online education, virtual events, gaming, and enhancing user experience. This tool enhances interactions and introduces novel emotional intelligence technologies.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Influence of Pseudo-Jahn-Teller Activity on the Singlet-Triplet Gap of Azaphenalenes**|Atreyee Majumdar et.al.|[2407.04552v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04552v1)|null|We probe the sensitivity of the singlet-triplet energy gap of selected azaphenalenes to symmetry lowering induced by Jahn-Teller interactions. While cyclazine in its characteristic $D_{\rm 3h}$ structure defies Hund's rule, CCSD(T)-level modeling suggests its structure corresponds to two equivalent minima of $C_{\rm 3h}$ symmetry undergoing rapid automerization. The combined effect of symmetry reduction and high-level corrections indicates a negligible singlet-triplet gap in cyclazine. Notably, pentazine and heptazine prefer symmetric structures exhibiting negative gaps in accord with experiments. Azaphenalenes containing nitrogen atoms at electron-deficient sites exhibit stronger in-plane structural distortion; in their low-symmetry energy minima, they adhere to Hund's rule.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Gaussian Eigen Models for Human Heads**|Wojciech Zielonka et.al.|[2407.04545v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545v1)|null|We present personalized Gaussian Eigen Models (GEMs) for human heads, a novel method that compresses dynamic 3D Gaussians into low-dimensional linear spaces. Our approach is inspired by the seminal work of Blanz and Vetter, where a mesh-based 3D morphable model (3DMM) is constructed from registered meshes. Based on dynamic 3D Gaussians, we create a lower-dimensional representation of primitives that applies to most 3DGS head avatars. Specifically, we propose a universal method to distill the appearance of a mesh-controlled UNet Gaussian avatar using an ensemble of linear eigenbasis. We replace heavy CNN-based architectures with a single linear layer improving speed and enabling a range of real-time downstream applications. To create a particular facial expression, one simply needs to perform a dot product between the eigen coefficients and the distilled basis. This efficient method removes the requirement for an input mesh during testing, enhancing simplicity and speed in expression generation. This process is highly efficient and supports real-time rendering on everyday devices, leveraging the effectiveness of standard Gaussian Splatting. In addition, we demonstrate how the GEM can be controlled using a ResNet-based regression architecture. We show and compare self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating higher quality and better control. A real-time demo showcases the applicability of the GEM representation.|

Typically, backscatter devices are used to achieve passive signal reflection modulation to facilitate information transmission or to interfere with radar echoes. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) or Metasurface is a promising technology that combines the advantages of backscatter devices and reflective array antennas. Previous studies demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve reflection modulation by utilizing the superposition of the quantified reflective coefficient (RC) of each unit but suffer from the computing complexity of codebook sequence, the safety of communication, and the flexibility of modulation. To overcome the difficulties, we propose new paradigm of metasurface, i.e. AWG-RIS, that can independently generate arbitrary baseband waveforms and beam patterns based on a magnitude-phase decoupled unit design without altering the beam pattern. We proposed an analysis framework and introduce waveform factor and beamforming factor into the new model which provide the theoretical support for the flow from the control signal to the outgoing electromagnetic wave. Furthermore, we introduce the world's first prototype that demonstrates passive arbitrary waveform generation without altering the beam pattern. The experiments validate the generation of arbitrary waveforms and spectrograms, both for a single input and through the superposition of multiple inputs.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Quantum effects and temperature dependence of the free energy barrier and shear frequency in bilayer graphene**|Jean Paul Nery et.al.|[2407.04532v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04532v1)|null|Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.|

Bending the geometry of the device is a must to observe hydrodynamic effects. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field, which is related with the ballistic-hydrodynamic transition. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow, and the experiment provides valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.|
|**2024-07-05**|**Peering inside the black box: Learning the relevance of many-body functions in Neural Network potentials**|Klara Bonneau et.al.|[2407.04526v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04526v1)|null|Machine learned potentials are becoming a popular tool to define an effective energy model for complex systems, either incorporating electronic structure effects at the atomistic resolution, or effectively renormalizing part of the atomistic degrees of freedom at a coarse-grained resolution. One of the main criticisms to machine learned potentials is that the energy inferred by the network is not as interpretable as in more traditional approaches where a simpler functional form is used. Here we address this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the nascent field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks (GNN). We demonstrate the approach on three different coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and water) and the protein NTL9. On these examples, we show that the neural network potentials can be in practice decomposed in relevance contributions to different orders, that can be directly interpreted and provide physical insights on the systems of interest.|
|**2024-07-05**|**More is Different: Mobile Ions Improve the Design Tolerances of Perovskite Solar Cells**|Lucy J. F. Hart et.al.|[2407.04523v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04523v1)|null|Many recent advances in metal halide perovskite solar cell (PSC) performance are attributed to surface treatments which passivate interfacial trap states, minimise charge recombination and boost photovoltages. Surprisingly, these photovoltages exceed the cells' built-in potentials, often with large energetic offsets reported between the perovskite and transport layer semiconductor band edges - contradicting standard photovoltaic design principles. Here we show that this tolerance to energetic offsets results from mixed ionic/electronic conduction in the perovskite layer. Combining drift-diffusion simulations with experiments probing the current-voltage performance of PSCs as a function of ion distribution, we demonstrate that electrostatic redistribution of ionic charge reduces surface recombination currents at steady-state, increasing the photovoltage by tens to hundreds of millivolts. Thus, mobile ions can reduce the sensitivity of photovoltage to energetic misalignments at perovskite/transport layer interfaces, benefitting overall efficiency. Building on these insights, we show how photovoltaic design principles are modified to account for mobile ions.|

To supply these many wavelengths of light, broadband sources are required, and spectrometers are employed to distinguish power per wavelength. Current multi-channel bNIRS instruments are bulky and only semi-portable due to technological limitations. We propose a design for a bNIRS device that has been miniaturized to allow for portable use. This design leverages the innovations in photonic devices that have created a new line of microspectrometers and broadband NIR high-power LEDs; the Hamamatsu SMD-type spectrometer C14384MA and the Ushio SMBBIR45-1100 LED. This first-of-itskind device, referred to as microCYRIL (after its two predecessors CYRIL and miniCYRIL), has been developed for oxygenation and metabolism measurements with dual channel operation. To verify functionality, concentration changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (HHb) haemoglobin and oxCCO were successfully tracked during a cuff-induced venous and arterial occlusion.|

Each species of chiral CNTs has an enantiomeric pair of left- and right-handed CNTs with nearly identical properties, but enantiomer-dependent phenomena can emerge, especially in nonlinear optical processes. Theoretical studies have predicted strong second-order nonlinearities for chiral CNTs, but there has been no experimental verification due to the lack of macroscopically ordered assemblies of single-enantiomer chiral CNTs. Here for the first time, we report the synthesis of centimeter-scale films of densely packed and aligned single-enantiomer chiral CNTs that exhibit micro-fabrication compatibility. We observe giant second harmonic generation (SHG) emission from the chiral CNT film, which originates from the intrinsic chirality and inversion symmetry breaking of the atomic structure of chiral CNTs. The observed value of the dominant element of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor reaches $1.5\times 10^{3}$ pm/V at a pump wavelength of 1030 nm, corresponding to the lowest-energy excitonic resonance. Our calculations based on many-body theory correctly estimate the spectrum and magnitude of such excitonically enhanced optical nonlinearity. These results are promising for developing scalable chiral-CNT electronics, nonlinear photonics and photonic quantum computing.|

This design paradigm greatly constrains the scalability and limits practical implementation of such systems. Here, we introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.|

However, many researchers employ arbitrary architectures for hyperspectral image processing, often without rigorous analysis of the interplay between spectral and spatial information. This oversight neglects the implications of combining these two modalities on model performance.   In this paper, we evaluate the performance of diverse deep learning architectures for hyperspectral image segmentation. Our analysis disentangles the impact of different architectures, spanning various spectral and spatial granularities. Specifically, we investigate the effects of spectral resolution (capturing spectral information) and spatial texture (conveying spatial details) on segmentation outcomes. Additionally, we explore the transferability of knowledge from large pre-trained image foundation models, originally designed for RGB images, to the hyperspectral domain.   Results show that incorporating spatial information alongside spectral data leads to improved segmentation results, and that it is essential to further work on novel architectures comprising spectral and spatial information and on the adaption of RGB foundation models into the hyperspectral domain.   Furthermore, we contribute to the field by cleaning and publicly releasing the Tecnalia WEEE Hyperspectral dataset. This dataset contains different non-ferrous fractions of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), including Copper, Brass, Aluminum, Stainless Steel, and White Copper, spanning the range of 400 to 1000 nm.   We expect these conclusions can guide novel researchers in the field of hyperspectral imaging.|

This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (EBD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.|

However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.|
