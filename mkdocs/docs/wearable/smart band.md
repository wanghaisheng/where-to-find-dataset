Begunovich et.al.|[2311.02024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02024v1)|null|We've studied the B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex (LH2) by several quantum chemical techniques based on the density functional theory (DFT) and determined the specific method and a minimal reliable model suitable for further studies of the LH2. In addition to bacteriochlorophyll a molecules, the minimal model includes two $\alpha$ and one $\beta$ chain amino acids. Within the model, we are able to reproduce the contribution of the B800 ring of nine bacteriochlorophyll a molecules to the near infrared $Q_y$ absorption band. We also discuss the use of hybrid DFT calculations for precise energy and optical estimations and DFT-based tight binding (DFTB) method for the large-scale calculations. Crucial importance of Hartree-Fock exchange interaction for the correct description of B800 peak position was shown.|

It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances.|

The InAs quantum dots are grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy on an InP substrate and are embedded into a quaternary $\mathrm{In}_{0.53}\mathrm{Al}_{0.23}\mathrm{Ga}_{0.24}\mathrm{As}$ membrane structure. In a post-growth flip-chip process with subsequent substrate removal and electron beam-lithography, circular Bragg grating ("bullseye") resonators are defined. Micro-photoluminescence studies of the devices at cryogenic temperatures of T = 5 K reveal individual quantum dot emission lines into a pronounced cavity mode. Time-correlated single-photon counting measurements under above-band gap excitation yield Purcell-enhanced excitonic decay times of $\tau = (180 \pm 3)$ ps corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P = (6.7 \pm 0.6)$. Pronounced photon antibunching with a background limited $g^{(2)}(0) = (0.057 \pm 0.004)$ is observed, which demonstrates that the light originated mostly from one single quantum dot.|

The study addresses the common problem of polysemy in search engines, where the same keyword may have multiple meanings. It proposes a solution to this issue by embedding a smart search function into the search engine, which can differentiate between different meanings based on sentiment. The study leverages sentiment analysis, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique, to classify and categorize news articles based on their emotional tone. This can provide more insightful and nuanced search results. The article reports an impressive accuracy rate of 85% for the proposed smart search function, which outperforms conventional search engines. This indicates the effectiveness of the sentiment-based approach. The research explores multiple sentiment analysis models, including Sentistrength and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), to determine the best-performing approach. The findings can be applied to enhance search engines, making them more capable of understanding the context and intent behind users 'queries. This can lead to better search results that are more aligned with what users are looking for. The proposed smart search function can improve the user experience by reducing the need to sift through irrelevant search results. This is particularly important in an age where information overload is common.|

We revisit its spinful phase diagram at half-filling as a consensus on the presence of SU($2$) symmetry is currently lacking. To start, we utilize the Hartree-Fock mean-field method, which offers a direct understanding of symmetry breaking through the effective mass term that can acquire spin dependence. Our results, in agreement with previous studies, provide an instructive insight into the regime where the Chern number $C=1$, with only one spin species remaining topological. Besides that, we numerically study the phase diagram of the Haldane-Hubbard model via a large-scale infinite-density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) method. The phase boundaries are determined by the Chern number and the correlation lengths obtained from the transfer-matrix spectrum. Unlike previous studies, the iDMRG method investigates the Haldane-Hubbard model on a thin and infinitely long cylinder and examines scenarios consistent with the two-dimensional thermodynamic limit. Here, the phase diagram we obtained qualitatively goes beyond the Hartree-Fock scope, particularly in the $C=1$ region, and serves as a quantitative benchmark for further theoretical and experimental investigations.|
|**2023-11-03**|**The advantage of Bolometric Interferometry for controlling Galactic foreground contamination in CMB primordial B-modes measurements**|E. Manzan et.al.|[2311.01814v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01814v1)|null|In the quest for the faint primordial B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, three are the key requirements for any present or future experiment: an utmost sensitivity, excellent control over instrumental systematic effects and over Galactic foreground contamination. Bolometric Interferometry (BI) is a novel technique that matches them all by combining the sensitivity of bolometric detectors, the control of instrumental systematics from interferometry and a software-based, tunable, in-band spectral resolution due to its ability to perform band-splitting during data analysis (spectral imaging). In this paper, we investigate how the spectral imaging capability of BI can help in detecting residual contamination in case an over-simplified model of foreground emission is assumed in the analysis. To mimic this situation, we focus on the next generation of ground-based CMB experiment, CMB-S4, and compare its anticipated sensitivities, frequency and sky coverage with a hypothetical version of the same experiment based on BI, CMB-S4/BI, assuming that line-of-sight (LOS) frequency decorrelation is present in dust emission but is not accounted for during component separation. We show results from a Monte-Carlo analysis based on a parametric component separation method (FGBuster), highlighting how BI has the potential to diagnose the presence of foreground residuals in estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the case of unaccounted Galactic dust LOS frequency decorrelation.|
|**2023-11-03**|**Imaging de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations and milli-Tesla pseudomagnetic fields**|Haibiao Zhou et.al.|[2311.01805v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01805v1)|null|A unique attribute of atomically thin quantum materials is the in-situ tunability of their electronic band structure by externally controllable parameters like electrostatic doping, electric field, strain, electron interactions, and displacement or twisting of atomic layers. This unparalleled control of the electronic bands has led to the discovery of a plethora of exotic emergent phenomena. But despite its key role, there is currently no versatile method for mapping the local band structure in advanced 2D materials devices in which the active layer is commonly embedded in various insulating layers and metallic gates. Utilizing a scanning superconducting quantum interference device, we image the de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations in a model system, the Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene with dual gates, which displays multiple highly-tunable bands. By resolving thermodynamic quantum oscillations spanning over 100 Landau levels in low magnetic fields, we reconstruct the band structure and its controllable evolution with the displacement field with unprecedented precision and spatial resolution of 150 nm. Moreover, by developing Landau level interferometry, we reveal shear-strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields and map their spatial dependence. In contrast to artificially-induced large strain, which leads to pseudomagnetic fields of hundreds of Tesla, we detect naturally occurring pseudomagnetic fields as low as 1 mT corresponding to graphene twisting by just 1 millidegree over one {\mu}m distance, two orders of magnitude lower than the typical angle disorder in high-quality twisted bilayer graphene devices. This ability to resolve the local band structure and strain on the nanoscale opens the door to the characterization and utilization of tunable band engineering in practical van der Waals devices.|
|**2023-11-03**|**Detection of X-ray Polarization in the High Synchrotron Peaked Blazar 1ES 1959+650**|Athira M. Bharathan et.al.|[2311.01745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01745v1)|null|We report the first time measurement of X-ray polarization in the 2$-$8 keV band from the high synchrotron peaked (HSP) blazar 1ES 1959+650. The low energy hump in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars in the log$\nu$ versus $\nu F_{\nu}$ plane is believed to be due to the synchrotron emission process from relativistic particles in their jets. In HSP blazars, the observed X-ray emission lies in the high energy tail of the synchrotron part of the SED, and X-ray polarization measurements can constrain the processes by which particles are accelerated in their jets. We present here our results on the X-ray polarization characteristics of 1ES 1959+650 using observations carried out by the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)}. {\it IXPE} observed this source for four epochs between May 2022 and August 2023, with observation time ranging from about 50 to 300 ksec. Of the four epochs of observations, we detected polarization on two epochs, significantly larger than the minimum detectable polarization values. From model-independent analysis during the observations on 28 October 2022, in the 2$-$8 keV band, we found the degree of polarization of $\Pi_X$ = 9.0 $\pm$ 1.6 \% and an electric vector position angle of $\psi_X$ = 53 $\pm$ 5 deg. Similarly, from the observations on 14 August 2023, we found $\Pi_X$ and $\psi_X$ values as 12.5 $\pm$ 0.7 \% and 20 $\pm$ 2 deg respectively in the 2$-$8 keV band. These values obtained from model-independent analysis are also in agreement with the values obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis of the I, Q, and U spectra in the 2$-$8 keV range. The measured X-ray polarization is larger than that known in the optical that ranges between 2.5$-$9\% during the period 2008 to 2018. This result can be inferred as the shock acceleration of the particles in the jet of 1ES 1959+650.|
|**2023-11-03**|**Improving full-waveform inversion based on sparse regularisation for geophysical data**|Jiahang Li et.al.|[2311.01688v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01688v1)|null|Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is an advanced geophysical inversion technique. In fields such as oil exploration and geology, FWI is used for providing images of subsurface structures with higher resolution. The conventional algorithm minimises the misfit error by calculating the least squares of the wavefield solutions between observed data and simulated data, followed by gradient direction and model update increment. Since the gradient is calculated by forward and backward wavefields, the high-accuracy model update relies on accurate forward and backward wavefield modelling. However, the quality of wavefield solutions obtained in practical situations could be poor and does not meet the requirements of high-resolution FWI. Specifically, the low-frequency wavefield is easily affected by noise and downsampling, which influences data quality, while the high-frequency wavefield is susceptible to spatial aliasing effects that produce imaging artefacts. Therefore, we propose using an algorithm called Sparse Relaxation Regularised Regression to optimise the wavefield solution in frequency domain FWI, which is the forward and backward wavefield obtained from the Helmholtz equation, and thus improve the accuracy of the FWI. The sparse relaxed regularised regression algorithm combines sparsity and regularisation, allowing the broadband FWI to reduce the effects of noise and outliers, which can provide data supplementation in the low-frequency band and anti-aliasing in the high-frequency band. Our numerical examples demonstrate the wavefield optimization effect of the sparse relaxed regularised regression-based algorithm in various cases. The accuracy and stability of the improved algorithm are verified in comparison to the Tikhonov regularisation algorithm.|

However, improving resonators is difficult without a robust and reliable method for coupling millimeter-wave signals to 2D structures. We develop and characterize a tapered transition structure coupling a rectangular waveguide to a planar slotline waveguide with better than 0.5 dB efficiency over 14 GHz, and use it to measure ground-shielded resonators in the W band (75-110 GHz). Having decoupled the resonators from radiative losses, we consistently achieve single-photon quality factors above $10^5$, with a two-level-system loss limit above $10^6$, and verify the effectiveness of oxide removal treatments to reduce loss. These values are 4-5 times higher than those previously reported in the W band, and much closer to typical planar microwave devices, demonstrating the potential for low-loss on-chip millimeter wave quantum technology.|

While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.|

Bejas et.al.|[2311.01413v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01413v1)|null|The essential building blocks of cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional CuO$_2$ sheets interspersed with charge reservoir layers. In bilayer cuprates, two closely spaced CuO$_2$ sheets are separated by a larger distance from the subsequent pair in the next unit cell. In contrast to single-layer cuprates, prior theoretical work on bilayer systems has predicted two distinct acoustic plasmon bands for a given out-of-plane momentum transfer. Here we report random phase approximation (RPA) calculations for bilayer systems which corroborate the existence of two distinct plasmons bands. We find that the intensity of the lower-energy band is negligibly small, whereas the higher-energy band carries significant spectral weight. We also present resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments at the O $K$-edge on the bilayer cuprate Y$_{0.85}$Ca$_{0.15}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Ca-YBCO), which show only one dispersive plasmon branch, in agreement with the RPA calculations. In addition, the RPA results indicate that the dispersion of the higher-energy plasmon band in Ca-YBCO is not strictly acoustic, but exhibits a substantial energy gap of approximately 250 meV at the two-dimensional Brillouin zone center.|

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.|

Bowes et.al.|[2311.01376v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01376v1)|null|We propose polarization of scattered optical light from intermediate Galactic latitude infrared cirrus as a new diagnostic to constrain models of interstellar dust and the anisotropic interstellar radiation field (aISRF). For single scattering by a sphere, with Mie scattering phase functions for intensity and polarized intensity for a dust model at a given wavelength (Sloan $r$ and $g$ bands), and with models of anisotropic illumination from the entire sky (represented in HEALPix), we develop the formalism for calculating useful summary parameters for an integrated flux nebula (IFN): average of the phase function weighted by the illumination, polarization angle ($\psi$), and polarization fraction ($p$). To demonstrate the diagnostic discrimination of polarization from scattered light, we report on the effects of different anisotropic illumination models and different dust models on the summary parameters for the Spider IFN. The summary parameters are also sensitive to the IFN location, as we illustrate using FRaNKIE illumination models. For assessing the viability of dust and aISRF models, we find that observations of $\psi$ and $p$ of scattered light are indeed powerful new diagnostics to complement joint modeling of the intensity of scattered light (related to the average phase function) and the intensity of thermal dust emission. However, optically thin IFNs that can be modelled using single scattering are faint and $p$ is not large, as it could be with Rayleigh scattering, and so these observations need to be carried out with care and precision. Results for the Draco nebula compared to the Spider illustrate the challenge.|

In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.|

Despite the advantages, previous beamforming schemes incur significant losses during beam scanning, particularly when hybrid beamforming is not employed. Consequently, this paper introduces an algorithm capable of compensating for these losses by increasing the power, for this, the algorithm will activate radiating elements required to address a specific Effective Isotropic Radiated Power for a beam pattern over Earth, projected from a GeoStationary satellite. In addition to the aforementioned compensation, other beam parameters have been addressed in the algorithm, such as beamwidth and Side Lobe Levels. To achieve these objectives, we propose employing the array thinning concept through the use of genetic algorithms, which enable beam shaping with the desired characteristics and power. The full array design considers an open-ended waveguide, configured to operate in circular polarization within the Ka-band frequency range of 17.7-20.2 GHz.|

Traditional SatCom systems struggle with efficient resource management due to static multibeam configurations, hindering quality of service (QoS) amidst dynamic traffic demands. This paper introduces an innovative solution - real-time adaptive beamforming on multibeam satellites with software-defined payloads in geostationary orbit (GEO). Utilizing a Direct Radiating Array (DRA) with circular polarization in the 17.7 - 20.2 GHz band, the paper outlines DRA design and a supervised learning-based algorithm for on-board beamforming. This adaptive approach not only meets precise beam projection needs but also dynamically adjusts beamwidth, minimizes sidelobe levels (SLL), and optimizes effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP).|

Utilizing these structural and electronic properties, we investigate ultrafast electron dynamics and high harmonic generation (HHG) from phosphorene subject to band structure engineering through external strain, based on ab initio time-dependent density-functional theory approach. We show that strong field processes in such systems can be optimized and controlled by biaxial tensile and compressive strain engineering, that results in electronic structure modification. While -10% strain resulted in closing of band gap, 2% strain increased the gap by 22% with respect to 0.9 eV in pristine phosphorene, consequently affecting the high harmonic yield. With reduction of gap, by applying strain from 2% to -10%, the valence band near $\Gamma-$point becomes more flat and discreet, resulting in large electronic density of states and enhanced electronic excitation, which reflects in their ultrafast sub-cycle dynamics under laser excitation. Moreover, due to its intrinsic in-plane anisotropy, harmonic yield with laser polarization along the armchair (AC) direction is found to be higher than that of the zigzag (ZZ) direction for all the strain cases. Nearly, an order of magnitude enhancement of harmonic intensity is achieved for -10% strain along AC direction. The current study expands the research possibilities of phosphorene into a previously unexplored domain, indicating its potential for future utilization in extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond nanophotonics, and also for efficient table-top HHG sources.|

Long-term video-EEG monitoring was conducted in 51 patients with focal epilepsy, 13 patients with generalized epilepsy, and 9 patients without epilepsy. Slow wave sleep segments were manually marked in the EEG and duration as well as EEG power spectra were extracted. Depressive symptoms were documented with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). At least mild depressive symptoms (BDI>9) were found among 23 patients with focal epilepsy, 5 patients with generalised epilepsy, and 6 patients who had no epilepsy diagnosis. Slow wave sleep duration was shorter for patients with at least mild depressive symptoms (p=.004), independently from epilepsy diagnosis, antiseizure medication, age, and sex. Psychoactive medication was associated with longer slow wave sleep duration (p=.008). Frontal sigma band power (13-15 Hz) during slow wave sleep was higher for patients without epilepsy and without depressive symptoms as compared to patients without depressive symptoms but with focal epilepsy (p=.005). Depressive symptoms affect slow wave sleep duration of patients with epilepsy similarly as in patients without epilepsy. Since reduced slow wave sleep can increase the likelihood of seizure occurrence, these results stress the importance of adequate treatment for patients with epilepsy who experience depressive symptoms.|

The former is the dominant effect in the cuprate superconductors or heavy fermion systems while the latter in twisted bilayer graphene or geometrically frustrated metals. However, the simultaneous cooperation of both effects in the same quantum material--the design principle to produce a correlated topological flat bands pinned at the Fermi level--remains rare. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report the observation of a flat band at the Fermi level in a 3$d$ pyrochlore metal CuV$_2$S$_4$. From a combination of first-principles calculations and slave-spin calculations, we understand the origin of this band to be a destructive quantum-interference effect associated with the V pyrochlore sublattice and further renormalization to the Fermi level by electron interactions in the partially filled V $t_{2g}$ orbitals. As a result, we find transport behavior that indicates a deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior as well as a large Sommerfeld coefficient. Our work demonstrates the pathway into correlated topology by constructing and pinning correlated flat bands near the Fermi level out of a pure $d$-electron system by the combined cooperation of local Coulomb interactions and geometric frustration in a pyrochlore lattice system.|

We demonstrate that free electrons in a vacuum can also emit highly directional monochromatic waves when they are in close proximity to a medium that is periodically modulated temporally, suggesting the existence of temporal Smith-Purcell effect. The momentum band gaps of time-varying media, such as photonic time crystals (PTCs), create new pathways for the injection of external energy, allowing the frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of the electromagnetic fields to be controlled. Moreover, the PTC substrate enables the conversion of localized evanescent fields into amplified, highly directional propagating plane waves that are only sensitive to the velocity of particles and the modulation frequency, which allows us to observe and utilize Cerenkov-like radiation in free space. Our work exhibits significant opportunities for the utilization of time-varying structures in various fields, including particle identification, ultraweak signal detection, and improved radiation source design.|

However, the cloud is not an optimal solution. To overcome this issue, fog computing is used to enable processing at the edge while still allowing communication with the cloud. Many applications rely on fog computing, including traffic management. In this paper, an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Mitigation System (ITCMS) is proposed to address traffic congestion in heavily populated smart cities. The proposed system is implemented using fog computing and tested in a crowded city. Its performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, such as traffic efficiency, energy savings, reduced latency, average traffic flow rate, and waiting time. The obtained results are compared with similar techniques that tackle the same issue. The results obtained indicate that the execution time of the simulation is 4,538 seconds, and the delay in the application loop is 49.67 seconds. The paper addresses various issues, including CPU usage, heap memory usage, throughput, and the total average delay, which are essential for evaluating the performance of the ITCMS. Our system model is also compared with other models to assess its performance. A comparison is made using two parameters, namely throughput and the total average delay, between the ITCMS, IOV (Internet of Vehicle), and STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on LOESS). Consequently, the results confirm that the proposed system outperforms the others in terms of higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved traffic efficiency.|

Spectral analysis in the non-flaring segment of the observation revealed that the equivalent width of the iron fluorescence emission is correlated with the observed absorption column density and the ratio of the iron K$\beta$ and K$\alpha$ line strength varied with the flux of the source. Coherent pulsations were detected with the spin period of the pulsar of 687.9$\pm$0.1 s, and a secondary pulsation was also detected with a period of 671.8$\pm$0.2 s, most prominent in the energy band of the iron line. At the spin period of the neutron star, the pulsation of the iron line has a low amplitude and the profile is different from the continuum. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy also revealed pulsations of the iron emission line during the non-flaring segment of the light curve. At the secondary period, both the iron line and the continuum have nearly identical pulse fraction and pulse profile. The additional periodicity can be attributed to the beat frequency between the spin of the neutron star and the Keplerian frequency of a stellar wind clump in retrograde motion around the neutron star. Reprocessed X-ray emissions originating from the clump can produce the observed secondary pulsations both in the continuum and the iron fluorescence line. The clump rotating around the neutron star is estimated to be approximately five lt-s away from the neutron star.|

Pasquini et.al.|[2311.01163v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01163v1)|null|[Abridged] JWST observations of the Orion Bar have shown the incredible richness of PAH bands and their variation on small scales. We aim to probe the photochemical evolution of PAHs across the key zones of the photodissociation region (PDR) that is the Orion Bar using unsupervised machine learning. We use NIRSpec and MIRI IFU data from the JWST ERS Program PDRs4All. We lever bisecting k-means clustering to generate detailed spatial maps of the spectral variability in several wavelength regions. We discuss the variations in the cluster profiles and connect them to the local physical conditions. We interpret these variations with respect to the key zones: the HII region, the atomic PDR zone, and the three dissociation fronts. The PAH emission exhibits spectral variation that depends strongly on spatial position in the PDR. We find the 8.6um band to behave differently than all other bands which vary systematically with one another. We find uniform variation in the 3.4-3.6um bands and 3.4/3.3 intensity ratio. We attribute the carrier of the 3.4-3.6um bands to a single side group attached to very similarly sized PAHs. Cluster profiles reveal a transition between characteristic profiles classes of the 11.2um feature from the atomic to the molecular PDR zone. We find the carriers of each of the profile classes to be independent, and reason the latter to be PAH clusters existing solely deep in the molecular PDR. Clustering also reveals a connection between the 11.2 and 6.2um bands; and that clusters generated from variation in the 10.9-11.63um region can be used to recover those in the 5.95-6.6um region. Clustering is a powerful tool for characterizing PAH variability on both spatial and spectral scales. For individual bands as well as global spectral behaviours, we find UV-processing to be the most important driver of the evolution of PAHs and their spectral signatures in the Orion Bar.|

Blazar AO 0235+164, located at redshift z = 0.94, has undergone several sharp multi-spectral-range flaring episodes during the last decades. In particular, the episodes peaking in 2008 and 2015, that received extensive multi-wavelength coverage, exhibited interesting behavior.   Aims. We study the actual origin of these two observed flares by constraining the properties of the observed photo-polarimetric variability, those of the broad-band spectral energy-distribution and the observed time-evolution behavior of the source as seen by ultra-high resolution total-flux and polarimetric Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging.   Methods. The analysis of VLBI images allows us to constrain kinematic and geometrical parameters of the 7 mm jet. We use the Discrete Correlation Function to compute the statistical correlation and the delays between emission at different spectral ranges. Multi-epoch modeling of the spectral energy distributions allows us to propose specific models of emission; in particular for the unusual spectral features observed in this source in the X-ray region of the spectrum during strong multi spectral-range flares.   Results. We find that these X-ray spectral features can be explained by an emission component originating in a separate particle distribution than the one responsible for the two standard blazar bumps. This is in agreement with the results of our correlation analysis that do not find a strong correlation between the X-rays and the remaining spectral ranges. We find that both external Compton dominated and synchrotron self-Compton dominated models can explain the observed spectral energy distributions. However, synchrotron self-Compton models are strongly favored by the delays and geometrical parameters inferred from the observations.|

The operators use dedicated frequency bands, but each RIS inadvertently reflects the transmitted uplink signals of the user equipment devices in multiple bands. Consequently, the concurrent reflection of pilot signals during the channel estimation phase introduces a new inter-operator pilot contamination effect. We investigate the implications of this effect in systems with either deterministic or correlated Rayleigh fading channels, specifically focusing on its impact on channel estimation quality, signal equalization, and channel capacity. The numerical results demonstrate the substantial degradation in system performance caused by this phenomenon and highlight the pressing need to address inter-operator pilot contamination in multi-operator RIS deployments. To combat the negative effect of this new type of pilot contamination, we propose to use orthogonal RIS configurations during uplink pilot transmission, which can mitigate or eliminate the negative effect of inter-operator pilot contamination at the expense of some inter-operator information exchange and orchestration.|

We found characteristic monochromatic radio powers of $P_\mathrm{char}=(2-13) \times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, $P_\mathrm{char}=2\times10^{24}-1.3\times10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, indicating that AGN-related radio emission is widespread in the sample. The signal-to-noise ratios of the redshift-binned median stacked maps are between $4-6$, and we expect that with the inclusion of the yet to be completed third-epoch VLASS observations, the detection limit defined as signal-to-noise ratio $\mathrm{SNR}\ge6$ could be reached, and the redshift dependence can be determined. To obtain information on the general spectral properties of the faint radio emission in high-redshift AGNs, we confined the sample to $\sim3000$ objects covered by both the VLASS and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey. We found that the flux densities from the median stacked maps show a characteristic spectral index of $\alpha^*=-0.30\pm0.15$, which is in agreement with the median spectral index of the radio-detected $z\ge4$ AGNs from our high-redshift AGN catalogue. The three-band mid-infrared colour--colour diagram based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer observations provides further support regarding the AGN contribution to the radio emission in the sub-mJy sample.|

Integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity is still challenging when targeting full-day usage for a satisfactory user experience. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of tiny machine-learning algorithms exploiting novel low-power processors to enable prolonged continuous operation in smart glasses. We explore the energy- and latency-efficient of smart glasses in the case of real-time object detection. To this goal, we designed a smart glasses prototype as a research platform featuring two microcontrollers, including a novel milliwatt-power RISC-V parallel processor with a hardware accelerator for visual AI, and a Bluetooth low-power module for communication. The smart glasses integrate power cycling mechanisms, including image and audio sensing interfaces. Furthermore, we developed a family of novel tiny deep-learning models based on YOLO with sub-million parameters customized for microcontroller-based inference dubbed TinyissimoYOLO v1.3, v5, and v8, aiming at benchmarking object detection with smart glasses for energy and latency. Evaluations on the prototype of the smart glasses demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's 17ms inference latency and 1.59mJ energy consumption per inference while ensuring acceptable detection accuracy. Further evaluation reveals an end-to-end latency from image capturing to the algorithm's prediction of 56ms or equivalently 18 fps, with a total power consumption of 62.9mW, equivalent to a 9.3 hours of continuous run time on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 fps per second.|

Researchers also target the development of flexible 6G non-terrestrial access architectures. The focus will be on the design of a multi-orbit and multi-band antenna for satellite user equipment (UE), as well as the development of gNodeB (gNB) and UE 5G non-terrestrial network equipment to support multi-connectivity.|

The transition from even- to odd-parity superconducting phase is supported by the P4/nmm crystal structure and it can be induced by the external magnetic field. Dual nature of the Ce $f$ electrons and competition between their itinerant and localized nature can be important for its physical proprieties. The existing electronic band structure in this material is still under debate. Energy scale occurring in the system can be important for adequate theoretical description of its supercomputing properties. In this paper, we discuss electronic band structure obtained from {\it ab initio} calculations. We analyze electronic surface states which can be compared with recently obtained angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement (ARPES). Additionally, we present the analyses of the hopping parameters obtained from the electronic band structure. The As-Rh layers are characterized by much more significant hopping parameters between atoms than these obtained for the Ce-Ce atoms. This suggests need of a revision of the tight binding model necessary for adequate description of the physical properties of CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.|
