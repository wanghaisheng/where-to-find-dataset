Begunovich et.al.|[2311.02024v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02024v1)|null|We've studied the B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex (LH2) by several quantum chemical techniques based on the density functional theory (DFT) and determined the specific method and a minimal reliable model suitable for further studies of the LH2. In addition to bacteriochlorophyll a molecules, the minimal model includes two $\alpha$ and one $\beta$ chain amino acids. Within the model, we are able to reproduce the contribution of the B800 ring of nine bacteriochlorophyll a molecules to the near infrared $Q_y$ absorption band. We also discuss the use of hybrid DFT calculations for precise energy and optical estimations and DFT-based tight binding (DFTB) method for the large-scale calculations. Crucial importance of Hartree-Fock exchange interaction for the correct description of B800 peak position was shown.|

We also give an explicit formula for the minimal number of generators of the defining ideal of the tangent cone of $C$ at $0$.|

This leads to explicit, often constructive, descriptions of some categorical constructions and properties that are implicit in universal algebra and algebraic theories. In particular, it is shown that the category of groups with a compatible action of a truss T (also called pointed T-modules) is isomorphic to the category of modules over the ring R(T) universally associated to the truss. This is widely used in the explicit description of free objects. Next, it is proven that the category of heaps of modules over T is isomorphic to the category of affine modules over R(T) and, in order to make the picture complete, that (in the unital case) these are in turn equivalent to a specific subcategory of the slice category of pointed T-modules over R(T). These correspondences and properties are then used to describe explicitly various (co)limits and to compare short exact sequences in the Barr-exact category of heaps of T-modules with short exact sequences as defined previously.|

It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances.|
|**2023-11-03**|**Regular bi-interpretability and finite axiomatizability of Chevalley groups**|Elena Bunina et.al.|[2311.01954v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01954v1)|null|In this paper we consider Chevalley groups over commutative rings with $1$, constructed by irreducible root systems of rank $>1$. We always suppose that for the systems $A_2, B_\ell, C_\ell, F_4, G_2$ our rings contain $1/2$ and for the system $G_2$ also $1/3$. Under these assumptions we prove that the central quotients of Chevalley groups are regularly bi-interpretable with the corresponding rings, the class of all central quotients of Chevalley groups of a given type is elementarily definable and even finitely axiomatizable. The same holds for adjoint Chevalley groups and for other Chevalley groups with some special condition of bounded generation. We also give an example of Chevalley group with infinite center, which is not bi-interpretable with the corresponding ring and is elementarily equivalent to a group that is not a Chevalley group itself.|

Because analytic formulae for the planet-induced outflow are useful for modeling its influences on local and global dust surface densities and planet accretion, we derive the analytic formulae that describe the morphology and velocity of the planet-induced outflow. We first perform three-dimensional, nonisothermal hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet, which enables us to introduce a fitting formula describing the morphology of the outflow. We then derive an analytic formula for the outflow speed using Bernoulli's theorem. We successfully derived a fitting formula for the midplane outflow morphology (the shape of the streamline), which is valid when the dimensionless thermal mass falls below $m\lesssim0.6$. The obtained analytic formulae for the outflow, such as the maximum outflow speed and the velocity distributions of the outflow in the radial and vertical directions to the disk, show good agreement with the numerical results. We find the following trends: (1) the maximum outflow speed increases with the planetary mass and has a peak of $\sim$30--40$\%$ of the sound speed when the dimensionless thermal mass is $m\sim0.3$, corresponding to a super-Earth mass planet at 1 au for the typical steady accretion disk model, and (2) the presence of the headwind (namely, the global pressure force acting in the positive radial direction of the disk) enhances (reduces) the outflow toward the outside (inside) of the planetary orbit. The planet-induced outflow of the gas affects the dust motion when the dimensionless stopping time of dust falls below ${\rm St}\lesssim\min(10m^2,0.1)$.|

The study addresses the common problem of polysemy in search engines, where the same keyword may have multiple meanings. It proposes a solution to this issue by embedding a smart search function into the search engine, which can differentiate between different meanings based on sentiment. The study leverages sentiment analysis, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique, to classify and categorize news articles based on their emotional tone. This can provide more insightful and nuanced search results. The article reports an impressive accuracy rate of 85% for the proposed smart search function, which outperforms conventional search engines. This indicates the effectiveness of the sentiment-based approach. The research explores multiple sentiment analysis models, including Sentistrength and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), to determine the best-performing approach. The findings can be applied to enhance search engines, making them more capable of understanding the context and intent behind users 'queries. This can lead to better search results that are more aligned with what users are looking for. The proposed smart search function can improve the user experience by reducing the need to sift through irrelevant search results. This is particularly important in an age where information overload is common.|
|**2023-11-03**|**Stable twisted cohomology of the mapping class groups in the exterior powers of the unit tangent bundle homology**|Nariya Kawazumi et.al.|[2311.01791v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01791v1)|null|We study the stable cohomology groups of the mapping class groups of surfaces with twisted coefficients given by the $d^{th}$ exterior powers of the first rational homology of the unit tangent bundles of the surfaces $\tilde{H}_{\mathbb{Q}}$. These coefficients are outside of the traditional framework of cohomological stability. They form a module $H_{\mathrm{st}}^{*}(\Lambda^{d}\tilde{H}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ over the stable cohomology algebra of the mapping class groups with trivial coefficients denoted by $\mathrm{Sym}_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathcal{E})$. If $d\neq 2$, the $\mathrm{Tor}$-group in each degree of $H_{\mathrm{st}}^{*}(\Lambda^{d}\tilde{H}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ does not vanish, and we compute all these $\mathrm{Tor}$-groups explicitly for $d \leq 5$. In particular, for each $d\neq 2$, the module $H_{\mathrm{st}}^{*}(\Lambda^{d}\tilde{H}_{\mathbb{Q}})$ is not free over $\mathrm{Sym}_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathcal{E})$, while it is free for $d=2$.For comparison, we also compute the stable cohomology group with coefficients in the $d^{th}$ exterior powers of the first rational cohomology of the unit tangent bundle of the surface, which fit into the classical framework of cohomological stability.|

Fibered toric varieties form a special case of toric variety bundles. In this note we first give an introduction to the class of fibered toric varieties. Then we use them to illustrate some known and conjectural results on topology and intersection theory of general toric variety bundles. Finally, using the language of fibered toric varieties, we compute the equivariant cohomology rings of smooth complete toric varieties.|

Thulasi et.al.|[2311.01706v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01706v1)|null|In our recent work, we introduced a generalization of the prime ideal factorization in Dedekind domains for submodules of finitely generated modules over Noetherian rings. In this article, we find conditions for the intersection of two submodules to have the same factorization as the submodules. We also find the relation between the factorizations of a submodule $N$ in an $R$-module $M$ and the ideal $\ann{M/N}$ in the ring $R$ and give a condition for their equality.|

The interplay of the competing nonlinearity with the potential enables the formation of a variety of solitons with complex structures, from dipole, quadrupole, and octupole solitons to necklace complexes. The system maintains two branches of soliton families with opposite slopes of the power-vs.-propagation-constant curves. While the solitons' stability domain slowly shrinks with the increase of even number $n$ of lobes in the multipole patterns, it remains conspicuous even for $n>16$. The application of a phase torque gives rise to stable rotation of the soliton complexes, as demonstrated by means of analytical and numerical methods.|

We show that higher strictifications do not exist for most $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-rings of interest in chromatic homotopy theory.|

This context maybe be conversational (relying on previous user queries or system responses), visual (relying on what the user sees, for example, on their screen), or background (based on signals such as a ringing alarm or playing music). In this work, we present an overview of MARRS, or Multimodal Reference Resolution System, an on-device framework within a Natural Language Understanding system, responsible for handling conversational, visual and background context. In particular, we present different machine learning models to enable handing contextual queries; specifically, one to enable reference resolution, and one to handle context via query rewriting. We also describe how these models complement each other to form a unified, coherent, lightweight system that can understand context while preserving user privacy.|

Today, the potential of HE remains largely unrealized as it is impractically slow, preventing it from being used in real applications. A major computational bottleneck in HE is the key-switching operation, accounting for approximately 70% of the overall HE execution time and involving a large amount of data for inputs, intermediates, and keys. Prior research has focused on hardware accelerators to improve HE performance, typically featuring large on-chip SRAMs and high off-chip bandwidth to deal with large scale data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve key-switching performance by rigorously analyzing its dataflow. Our primary goal is to optimize data reuse with limited on-chip memory to minimize off-chip data movement. We introduce three distinct dataflows: Max-Parallel (MP), Digit-Centric (DC), and Output-Centric (OC), each with unique scheduling approaches for key-switching computations. Through our analysis, we show how our proposed Output-Centric technique can effectively reuse data by significantly lowering the intermediate key-switching working set and alleviating the need for massive off-chip bandwidth. We thoroughly evaluate the three dataflows using the RPU, a recently published vector processor tailored for ring processing algorithms, which includes HE. This evaluation considers sweeps of bandwidth and computational throughput, and whether keys are buffered on-chip or streamed. With OC, we demonstrate up to 4.16x speedup over the MP dataflow and show how OC can save 16x on-chip SRAM by streaming keys for minimal performance penalty.|

As a result, it is now of considerable interest to identify what aspects of the underlying spacetime are constrained by these observations. For this purpose, we present a new formulation of an existing broad class of integrable, axisymmetric, stationary spinning black hole spacetimes, specified by four free radial functions, that makes manifest which functions are responsible for setting the location and morphology of the event horizon and ergosphere. We explore the size of the black hole shadow and high-order photon rings for polar observers, approximately appropriate for the EHT observations of M87*, finding analogous expressions to those for general spherical spacetimes. Of particular interest, we find that these are independent of the properties of the ergosphere, but does directly probe on the free function that defines the event horizon. Based on these, we extend the nonperturbative, nonparametric characterization of the gravitational implications of various near-horizon measurements to spinning spacetimes. Finally, we demonstrate this characterization for a handful of explicit alternative spacetimes.|

While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.|

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.|

In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.|

The coupling between light and spins is inherently non-linear, and occurs via multi-photon processes like Raman scattering and two-photon absorption/emission with electronically excited intermediate states. Based on this, two pathways are elucidated: (i) In the absence of external driving, long-range interactions are mediated by the exchange of at least two virtual cavity photons. We show that these vacuum-mediated interactions can surpass local Heisenberg interactions in mesoscopic setups such as sufficiently small split-ring resonators. (ii) In a laser-driven cavity, interactions can be tailored through a hybrid scheme involving both external laser photons and cavity photons. This offers a versatile pathway for Floquet engineering of long-range interactions in macroscopic systems. In general, the derivation of these interactions requires careful consideration: Notably, we demonstrate that a simple phenomenological approach, based on a spin-photon Hamiltonian that captures Raman and two-photon processes with effective matrix elements, can be used only if the cavity is resonantly driven. Outside of these narrow resonant regimes as well as for the undriven case, a fourth-order series expansion within the underlying electronic model is necessary, which we perform to obtain long-range four-spin interactions in the half-filled Hubbard model.|
|**2023-11-02**|**Comparison of moving and stationary clapping bodies**|Suyog V Mahulkar et.al.|[2311.01309v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01309v1)|null|We report differences in the flow dynamics and in the body kinematics between a clapping body that is allowed to propel forward freely (Dynamic) and one that is constrained from moving forward (Stationary). The experiments were done in quiescent water. The body consists of two interconnected plates hinged at one end with a 'torsion' spring. Initially, a thread loop holds the plates apart at an interplate angle of 60 degrees. Cutting of the thread initiates the clapping motion, and if allowed, the body propels forward a certain distance. Experiments have been performed for three values of $d^*$(= depth/length): 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5. In both cases, vortex loops initially develop along the three edges of each plate, which reconnect by the end of the clapping motion resulting in the formation of an elliptical vortex loop in the wake for $d^*$ = 1.5, 1.0 bodies, and multiple connected rings for $d^*$ = 0.5 bodies. Three main and unexpected differences are observed between the 'Dynamic' and 'Stationary' bodies. In the dynamic case, the clapping action is faster compared to the stationary case, with the maximum angular plate velocity being twice as high. The mean thrust coefficient, $\overline{C_T}$, based on plate tip velocity, is higher for the stationary. The value of $\overline{C_T}$ and the circulation in the starting vortices is almost independent of $d^*$ for the dynamic case, whereas it increases with $d^*$ for the stationary case. The core separation of starting vortices closely matches in both stationary and dynamic cases although circulation varies.|

The excluded volume interactions have been switched off and only the interactions of entropic origin arising from the topological constraints are considered. An interpretation from the polymer point of view of the field equations that minimize the energy of the model in the limit in which one of the spatial dimensions of the 4-plat becomes very large is provided. It is shown that the self-dual contributions are responsible for the long-range interactions that are necessary for preserving the global topological properties of the system during the thermal fluctuations. The non self-dual part is also related to the topological constraints, and takes into account the local interactions acting on the monomers in order to prevent the breaking of the polymer lines. It turns out that the energy landscape of the two linked rings is quite complex. Assuming as a rough approximation that the monomer densities of half of the 4-plat are constant, at least two points of energy minimum are found. Classes of non-trivial self-dual solutions of the self-dual field equations are derived. ... .|

However, the cloud is not an optimal solution. To overcome this issue, fog computing is used to enable processing at the edge while still allowing communication with the cloud. Many applications rely on fog computing, including traffic management. In this paper, an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Mitigation System (ITCMS) is proposed to address traffic congestion in heavily populated smart cities. The proposed system is implemented using fog computing and tested in a crowded city. Its performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, such as traffic efficiency, energy savings, reduced latency, average traffic flow rate, and waiting time. The obtained results are compared with similar techniques that tackle the same issue. The results obtained indicate that the execution time of the simulation is 4,538 seconds, and the delay in the application loop is 49.67 seconds. The paper addresses various issues, including CPU usage, heap memory usage, throughput, and the total average delay, which are essential for evaluating the performance of the ITCMS. Our system model is also compared with other models to assess its performance. A comparison is made using two parameters, namely throughput and the total average delay, between the ITCMS, IOV (Internet of Vehicle), and STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on LOESS). Consequently, the results confirm that the proposed system outperforms the others in terms of higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved traffic efficiency.|
|**2023-11-02**|**Phase diagram of QCD matter with magnetic field: domain-wall Skyrmion chain in chiral soliton lattice**|Munoru Eto et.al.|[2311.01112v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01112v1)|null|QCD matter in strong magnetic field exhibits a rich phase structure. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the chiral Lagrangian for two flavors is accompanied by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term containing an anomalous coupling of the neutral pion $\pi_0$ to the magnetic field via the chiral anomaly. Due to this term, the ground state is inhomogeneous in the form of either chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons in the direction of magnetic field, or domain-wall Skyrmion (DWSk) phase in which Skyrmions supported by $\pi_3[{\rm SU}(2)] \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ appear inside the solitons as topological lumps supported by $\pi_2(S^2) \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ in the effective worldvolume theory of the soliton. In this paper, we determine the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the single-soliton approximation, within the leading order of chiral perturbation theory. To this end, we explore a domain-wall Skyrmion chain in multiple soliton configurations. First, we construct the effective theory of the CSL by the moduli approximation, and obtain the ${\mathbb C}P^1$ model or O(3) model, gauged by a background electromagnetic gauge field, with two kinds of topological terms coming from the WZW term: one is the topological lump charge in 2+1 dimensional worldvolume and the other is a topological term counting the soliton number. Topological lumps in the 2+1 dimensional worldvolume theory are superconducting rings and their sizes are constrained by the flux quantization condition. The negative energy condition of the lumps yields the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases. We find that a large region inside the CSL is occupied by the DWSk phase, and that the CSL remains metastable in the DWSk phase in the vicinity of the phase boundary.|

Integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity is still challenging when targeting full-day usage for a satisfactory user experience. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of tiny machine-learning algorithms exploiting novel low-power processors to enable prolonged continuous operation in smart glasses. We explore the energy- and latency-efficient of smart glasses in the case of real-time object detection. To this goal, we designed a smart glasses prototype as a research platform featuring two microcontrollers, including a novel milliwatt-power RISC-V parallel processor with a hardware accelerator for visual AI, and a Bluetooth low-power module for communication. The smart glasses integrate power cycling mechanisms, including image and audio sensing interfaces. Furthermore, we developed a family of novel tiny deep-learning models based on YOLO with sub-million parameters customized for microcontroller-based inference dubbed TinyissimoYOLO v1.3, v5, and v8, aiming at benchmarking object detection with smart glasses for energy and latency. Evaluations on the prototype of the smart glasses demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's 17ms inference latency and 1.59mJ energy consumption per inference while ensuring acceptable detection accuracy. Further evaluation reveals an end-to-end latency from image capturing to the algorithm's prediction of 56ms or equivalently 18 fps, with a total power consumption of 62.9mW, equivalent to a 9.3 hours of continuous run time on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 fps per second.|

The countermeasure against FIA may lead to a vulnerability for SCA when the whole algorithm needs to be masked (in environments like smart cards). This led to a variant of the LCD and LCP problems, where several results have been obtained intensively for LCD codes, but only partial results have been derived for LCP codes. Given the gap between the thin results and their particular importance, this paper aims to reduce this by further studying the LCP of codes in special code families and, precisely, the characterisation and construction mechanism of LCP codes of algebraic geometry codes over finite fields. Notably, we propose constructing explicit LCP of codes from elliptic curves. Besides, we also study the security parameters of the derived LCP of codes $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ (notably for cyclic codes), which are given by the minimum distances $d(\mathcal{C})$ and $d(\mathcal{D}^\perp)$. Further, we show that for LCP algebraic geometry codes $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}$ under some specific conditions we exhibit. Finally, we investigate whether MDS LCP of algebraic geometry codes exist (MDS codes are among the most important in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests). Construction schemes for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve were given in 2018 by Mesnager, Tang and Qi in [``Complementary dual algebraic geometry codes", IEEE Trans. Inform Theory, vol. 64(4), 2390--3297, 2018]. To our knowledge, it is the first time LCP of algebraic geometry codes has been studied.|

However, when a single video frame becomes the input, these works usually fail to address degradations caused by video compression, such as mosquito noise, ringing, blockiness, and staircase noise. In this work, we for the first time, present a video compression-based degradation model to synthesize low-resolution image data in the blind SISR task. Our proposed image synthesizing method is widely applicable to existing image datasets, so that a single degraded image can contain distortions caused by the lossy video compression algorithms. This overcomes the leak of feature diversity in video data and thus retains the training efficiency. By introducing video coding artifacts to SISR degradation models, neural networks can super-resolve images with the ability to restore video compression degradations, and achieve better results on restoring generic distortions caused by image compression as well. Our proposed approach achieves superior performance in SOTA no-reference Image Quality Assessment, and shows better visual quality on various datasets. In addition, we evaluate the SISR neural network trained with our degradation model on video super-resolution (VSR) datasets. Compared to architectures specifically designed for the VSR purpose, our method exhibits similar or better performance, evidencing that the presented strategy on infusing video-based degradation is generalizable to address more complicated compression artifacts even without temporal cues.|

In recent years, video instance segmentation, which aims to track and segment multiple objects in video frames, has drawn much attention for its potential applications in various emerging areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and smart retail. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for instance-level visual analysis on video frames, which can simultaneously conduct object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. The core idea of our method is collaborative multi-task learning which is achieved by a novel structure, named associative connections among detection, segmentation, and tracking task heads in an end-to-end learnable CNN. These additional connections allow information propagation across multiple related tasks, so as to benefit these tasks simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on KITTI MOTS and MOTS Challenge datasets and obtain quite encouraging results.|

Our investigation is focused on various bulk observables, which include charged particle multiplicity ($N_{\text{ch}}$), average transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\text{T}}\rangle$), initial eccentricity ($\epsilon_{n}$), and flow harmonics ($v_{n}$), for different orientations of U+U collisions within the range of $0^{\circ} < \theta < 120 ^{\circ}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm NN}} = 2.12$ GeV ($p_{\mathrm lab}$ = 500 MeV). Among the various collision configurations at this energy, the tip-tip scenario emerged with the highest average charged particle multiplicity, denoted as $\langle N_{\text{ch}} \rangle$. Notably, both the second and third-order eccentricities, $\epsilon_{2,3}$, revealed intricate patterns as they varied with impact parameter across distinct configurations. The tip-tip configuration displayed the most pronounced magnitude of rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_{1}$), whereas the body-body configuration exhibited the least pronounced magnitude. Concerning elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) near mid-rapidity ($\eta < 1.0$), a negative sign is observed for all configurations except for the side-side exhibited a distinctly positive sign. Within the spectrum of configurations, the body-body scenario displayed the highest magnitude of $v_{2}$. For reaction plane correlated triangular flow ($v_{3}$), the body-body configuration emerged with the largest magnitude while the side-side exhibited the smallest magnitude. Our study seeks to establish a fundamental understanding of various U+U collision configurations in preparation for the forthcoming CEE experiment.|
