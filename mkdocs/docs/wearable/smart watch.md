It also investigates the role of Web3 applications in shaping the future of the internet. The primary objective is to propose a novel design for 'smart certificates,' which are digital certificates that can be programmatically enforced. Utilizing such certificates, an enterprise can better protect itself from cyberattacks and ensure the security of its data and systems. Web3 recent security solutions by companies and projects like Certik, Forta, Slither, and Securify are the equivalent of code scanning tool that were originally developed for Web1 and Web2 applications, and definitely not like certificates to help enterprises feel safe against cyberthreats. We aim to improve the resilience of enterprises' digital infrastructure by building on top of Web3 application and put methodologies in place for vulnerability analysis and attack correlation, focusing on architecture of different layers, Wallet/Client, Application and Smart Contract, where specific components are provided to identify and predict threats and risks. Furthermore, Certificate Transparency is used for enhancing the security, trustworthiness and decentralized management of the certificates, and detecting misuses, compromises, and malfeasances.|

The study addresses the common problem of polysemy in search engines, where the same keyword may have multiple meanings. It proposes a solution to this issue by embedding a smart search function into the search engine, which can differentiate between different meanings based on sentiment. The study leverages sentiment analysis, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) technique, to classify and categorize news articles based on their emotional tone. This can provide more insightful and nuanced search results. The article reports an impressive accuracy rate of 85% for the proposed smart search function, which outperforms conventional search engines. This indicates the effectiveness of the sentiment-based approach. The research explores multiple sentiment analysis models, including Sentistrength and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER), to determine the best-performing approach. The findings can be applied to enhance search engines, making them more capable of understanding the context and intent behind users 'queries. This can lead to better search results that are more aligned with what users are looking for. The proposed smart search function can improve the user experience by reducing the need to sift through irrelevant search results. This is particularly important in an age where information overload is common.|

While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of smart contract governance. This paper presents a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research papers, we develop a governance taxonomy to examine these issues. We collect and analyze 4,446 audit reports from 17 reputable Web3 security companies, categorizing the governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. In addition, we identify vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation processes, e.g., flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. To aid in the identification of the main topics of governance issues, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Moreover, we explore the challenges associated with maintaining consistency between the code and the whitepaper in DeFi applications, providing valuable insights for addressing this issue in the future. We build a prototype tool based on artificial intelligence (AI), representing an initial attempt to uncover potential solutions. We validate this prototype across eight DeFi projects, achieving a 56.14% F1 score and a 80% recall. Through this study, we expect to assist the design and development teams of DeFi applications, as well as users, researchers, and regulators, in better understanding and addressing governance challenges, thereby fostering the healthy development of DeFi.|

Ethereum plays a pivotal role in facilitating smart contracts and decentralized applications. Understanding information propagation dynamics in Ethereum is crucial for ensuring network efficiency, security, and scalability. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to analyze the information propagation patterns in the Ethereum network. The first phase of our research involves data collection from the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of blocks, transactions, and node degrees. We construct a transaction graph representation using adjacency matrices to capture the node embeddings; while our major contribution is to develop a combined Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimize the network efficiency and scalability. It learns the best actions to take in various network states, ultimately leading to improved network efficiency, throughput, and optimize gas limits for block processing. In the experimental evaluation, we analyze the performance of our model on a large-scale Ethereum dataset. We investigate effectively aggregating information from neighboring nodes capturing graph structure and updating node embeddings using GCN with the objective of transaction pattern prediction, accounting for varying network loads and number of blocks. Not only we design a gas limit optimization model and provide the algorithm, but also to address scalability, we demonstrate the use and implementation of sparse matrices in GraphConv, GraphSAGE, and GAT. The results indicate that our designed GAT-RL model achieves superior results compared to other GCN models in terms of performance. It effectively propagates information across the network, optimizing gas limits for block processing and improving network efficiency.|

In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.|

However, the cloud is not an optimal solution. To overcome this issue, fog computing is used to enable processing at the edge while still allowing communication with the cloud. Many applications rely on fog computing, including traffic management. In this paper, an Intelligent Traffic Congestion Mitigation System (ITCMS) is proposed to address traffic congestion in heavily populated smart cities. The proposed system is implemented using fog computing and tested in a crowded city. Its performance is evaluated based on multiple metrics, such as traffic efficiency, energy savings, reduced latency, average traffic flow rate, and waiting time. The obtained results are compared with similar techniques that tackle the same issue. The results obtained indicate that the execution time of the simulation is 4,538 seconds, and the delay in the application loop is 49.67 seconds. The paper addresses various issues, including CPU usage, heap memory usage, throughput, and the total average delay, which are essential for evaluating the performance of the ITCMS. Our system model is also compared with other models to assess its performance. A comparison is made using two parameters, namely throughput and the total average delay, between the ITCMS, IOV (Internet of Vehicle), and STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on LOESS). Consequently, the results confirm that the proposed system outperforms the others in terms of higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved traffic efficiency.|

Integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity is still challenging when targeting full-day usage for a satisfactory user experience. This paper illustrates the design and implementation of tiny machine-learning algorithms exploiting novel low-power processors to enable prolonged continuous operation in smart glasses. We explore the energy- and latency-efficient of smart glasses in the case of real-time object detection. To this goal, we designed a smart glasses prototype as a research platform featuring two microcontrollers, including a novel milliwatt-power RISC-V parallel processor with a hardware accelerator for visual AI, and a Bluetooth low-power module for communication. The smart glasses integrate power cycling mechanisms, including image and audio sensing interfaces. Furthermore, we developed a family of novel tiny deep-learning models based on YOLO with sub-million parameters customized for microcontroller-based inference dubbed TinyissimoYOLO v1.3, v5, and v8, aiming at benchmarking object detection with smart glasses for energy and latency. Evaluations on the prototype of the smart glasses demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's 17ms inference latency and 1.59mJ energy consumption per inference while ensuring acceptable detection accuracy. Further evaluation reveals an end-to-end latency from image capturing to the algorithm's prediction of 56ms or equivalently 18 fps, with a total power consumption of 62.9mW, equivalent to a 9.3 hours of continuous run time on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 fps per second.|

The countermeasure against FIA may lead to a vulnerability for SCA when the whole algorithm needs to be masked (in environments like smart cards). This led to a variant of the LCD and LCP problems, where several results have been obtained intensively for LCD codes, but only partial results have been derived for LCP codes. Given the gap between the thin results and their particular importance, this paper aims to reduce this by further studying the LCP of codes in special code families and, precisely, the characterisation and construction mechanism of LCP codes of algebraic geometry codes over finite fields. Notably, we propose constructing explicit LCP of codes from elliptic curves. Besides, we also study the security parameters of the derived LCP of codes $(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ (notably for cyclic codes), which are given by the minimum distances $d(\mathcal{C})$ and $d(\mathcal{D}^\perp)$. Further, we show that for LCP algebraic geometry codes $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D})$, the dual code $\mathcal{C}^\perp$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{D}$ under some specific conditions we exhibit. Finally, we investigate whether MDS LCP of algebraic geometry codes exist (MDS codes are among the most important in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests). Construction schemes for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve were given in 2018 by Mesnager, Tang and Qi in [``Complementary dual algebraic geometry codes", IEEE Trans. Inform Theory, vol. 64(4), 2390--3297, 2018]. To our knowledge, it is the first time LCP of algebraic geometry codes has been studied.|

In recent years, video instance segmentation, which aims to track and segment multiple objects in video frames, has drawn much attention for its potential applications in various emerging areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and smart retail. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for instance-level visual analysis on video frames, which can simultaneously conduct object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking. The core idea of our method is collaborative multi-task learning which is achieved by a novel structure, named associative connections among detection, segmentation, and tracking task heads in an end-to-end learnable CNN. These additional connections allow information propagation across multiple related tasks, so as to benefit these tasks simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on KITTI MOTS and MOTS Challenge datasets and obtain quite encouraging results.|

We conduct a survey across 12 agronomists to understand these networking requirements of farm workloads and perform extensive measurements of WiFi 6 performance in a farm to identify the challenges in meeting them. Our measurements reveal how network capacity is fundamentally limited in such a setting, with severe degradation in network performance due to crop canopy, and spotlight farm networks as an emerging new problem domain that can benefit from smarter network resource management decisions. To that end, we design Cornet, a network for supporting on-farm applications that comprises: (i) a multi-hop mesh of WiFi routers that uses a strategic combination of 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands as informed by our measurements, and (ii) a centralized traffic engineering (TE) system that uses a novel abstraction of resource units to reason about wireless network capacity and make TE decisions (schedule flows, assign flow rates, and select routes and channels). Our evaluation, using testbeds in a farm and trace-driven simulations, shows how Cornet achieves 1.4 $\times$ higher network utilization and better meets application demands, compared to standard wireless mesh strategies.|

SAGE integrates information about user preferences, device states, and external factors (such as weather and TV schedules) through the orchestration of a collection of tools. SAGE's capabilities include learning user preferences from natural-language utterances, interacting with devices by reading their API documentation, writing code to continuously monitor devices, and understanding natural device references. To evaluate SAGE, we develop a benchmark of 43 highly challenging smart home tasks, where SAGE successfully achieves 23 tasks, significantly outperforming existing LLM-enabled baselines (5/43).|

These systems need to have a sophisticated understanding of the user as well as the environment, and make timely accurate decisions on when and what to say. To address this issue, we created a new multimodal benchmark dataset, Watch, Talk and Guide (WTaG) based on natural interaction between a human user and a human instructor. We further proposed two tasks: User and Environment Understanding, and Instructor Decision Making. We leveraged several foundation models to study to what extent these models can be quickly adapted to perceptually enabled task guidance. Our quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluation results show that these models can demonstrate fair performances in some cases with no task-specific training, but a fast and reliable adaptation remains a significant challenge. Our benchmark and baselines will provide a stepping stone for future work on situated task guidance.|

Noise not only influences the working efficiency but also the human's health. The problem of reducing noise is one of great importance and great difficulty. The problem has been addressed in many ways over the years. The current methods for noise reducing mostly rely on the materials and transmission medium, which are only effective to some extent for the high frequency noise. However, the effective reduction noise method especially for low frequency noise is very limited.   Here we come up with a noise reduction system consist of a sensor to detect the noise in the environment. Then the noise will be sent to an electronic control system to process the noise, which will generate a reverse phase frequency signal to counteract the disturbance. Finally, the processed smaller noise will be broadcasted by the speaker. Through this smart noise reduction system, even the noise with low-frequency can be eliminated.   The system is also integrated with sleep tracking and music player applications. It can also remember and store settings for the same environment, sense temperature, and smart control of home furniture, fire alarm, etc. This smart system can transfer data easily by Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and controlled by its APP.   In this project, we will present a model of the above technology which can be used in various environments to prevent noise pollution and provide a solution to the people who have difficulties finding a peaceful and quiet environment for sleep, work or study.|

When a BH becomes saturated with large-scale vertical magnetic flux, it enters a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD) state. The dynamically-important BH magnetic flux powers highly efficient relativistic outflows (or jets) and sporadically erupts from the BH into the disk midplane. Here we explore the evolution of MADs when the BH and gas angular momentum are misaligned, which is expected to be more common. Using numerical simulations, we find that jets from rapidly spinning, prograde BHs force the inner accretion flow into alignment with the BH spin via the magneto-spin alignment mechanism for disks initially misaligned at $\mathcal{T}\lesssim 60^{\circ}$. Extremely misaligned MAD disks, on the other hand, exhibit intermittent jets that blow out parts of the disk to $\approx 100$ gravitational radii before collapsing, leaving behind hot cavities and magnetized filaments. These intermittent jet mechanism forms a mini-feedback cycle and could explain some cases of X-ray and radio quasi-periodic eruptions observed in dim AGN. Further, we find that (i) for BHs with low power jets, the BH spin and initial disk tilt angle changes the amount of horizon magnetic flux, and (ii) geometrically-thick, misaligned accretion flows do not undergo sustained Lense-Thirring (LT) precession. Thereby, we suggest that low-luminosity accreting BHs ($\dot{M}\ll 10^{-3} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$) are not likely to exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations in lightcurves due to LT precession, in agreement with observations of BH X-ray binaries and AGN in the low-hard/quiescent state. Instead, we suggest that magnetic flux eruptions can mimic precession-like motion, such as observed in the M87 jet, by driving large-scale surface waves in the jets.|

Numerous vulnerabilities and attacks have been identified and exploited, resulting in significant financial losses. In response, researchers have developed various tools and techniques to identify and prevent vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In this survey, we present a systematic overview of the quality assurance of smart contracts, covering vulnerabilities, attacks, defenses, and tool support. By classifying vulnerabilities based on known attacks, we can identify patterns and common weaknesses that need to be addressed. Moreover, in order to effectively protect smart contracts, we have created a labeled dataset to evaluate various vulnerability detection tools and compare their effectiveness.|

Altman et.al.|[2311.00170v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00170v1)|null|Coupled learning is a contrastive scheme for tuning the properties of individual elements within a network in order to achieve desired functionality of the system. It takes advantage of physics both to learn using local rules and to "compute" the output response to input data, thus enabling the system to perform decentralized computation without the need for a processor or external memory. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept mechanical network that can learn simple tasks such as self-symmetrizing via iterative tuning of individual spring rest lengths. These mechanical networks could feasibly be scaled and automated to solve increasingly complex tasks, hinting at a new class of "smart" metamaterials.|

Egocentric vision has the unique potential to detect the walking environment prior to physical interactions, which can improve transitions to and from stairs. This motivated us to create the StairNet initiative to support the development of new deep learning models for visual sensing and recognition of stairs, with an emphasis on lightweight and efficient neural networks for onboard real-time inference. In this study, we present an overview of the development of our large-scale dataset with over 515,000 manually labeled images, as well as our development of different deep learning models (e.g., 2D and 3D CNN, hybrid CNN and LSTM, and ViT networks) and training methods (e.g., supervised learning with temporal data and semi-supervised learning with unlabeled images) using our new dataset. We consistently achieved high classification accuracy (i.e., up to 98.8%) with different designs, offering trade-offs between model accuracy and size. When deployed on mobile devices with GPU and NPU accelerators, our deep learning models achieved inference speeds up to 2.8 ms. We also deployed our models on custom-designed CPU-powered smart glasses. However, limitations in the embedded hardware yielded slower inference speeds of 1.5 seconds, presenting a trade-off between human-centered design and performance. Overall, we showed that StairNet can be an effective platform to develop and study new visual perception systems for human-robot locomotion with applications in exoskeleton and prosthetic leg control.|

Nonetheless, there exist numerous unconventional situations where IoT technologies have not yet been massively applied, though they can be extremely useful. One of such domains is the underground mining sector, where enhancing automation monitoring through wireless communications is of essential significance. In this paper, we focus on the development, implementation, and evaluation of a LoRa-based multi-hop network tailored specifically for monitoring underground mining environments, where data traffic is sporadic, but energy efficiency is of paramount importance. We hence define a synchronization framework that makes it possible for the nodes to sleep for most of the time, waking up only when they need to exchange traffic. Notably, our network achieves a sub 40us proven synchronization accuracy between parent-child pairs with minimum overhead for diverse topologies, rendering it highly viable for subterranean operations. Furthermore, for proper network dimensioning, we model the interplay between network's throughput, frame size, and sampling periods of potential applications. Moreover, we propose a model to estimate devices' duty cycle based on their position within the multi-hop network, along with empirical observations for its validation. The proposed models make it possible to optimize the network's performance to meet the specific demands that can arise from the different subterranean use cases, in which robustness, low power operation, and compliance with radio-frequency regulations are key requirements that must be met.|

Nevertheless, one of the most important challenges to this endeavor lies in identifying the most suitable consumer clusters with similar consumption behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning based framework in order to achieve optimal load profiling through a real case study, utilizing data from almost 5000 households in London. Four widely used clustering algorithms are applied specifically K-means, K-medoids, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and Density-based Spatial Clustering. An empirical analysis as well as multiple evaluation metrics are leveraged to assess those algorithms. Following that, we redefine the problem as a probabilistic classification one, with the classifier emulating the behavior of a clustering algorithm,leveraging Explainable AI (xAI) to enhance the interpretability of our solution. According to the clustering algorithm analysis the optimal number of clusters for this case is seven. Despite that, our methodology shows that two of the clusters, almost 10\% of the dataset, exhibit significant internal dissimilarity and thus it splits them even further to create nine clusters in total. The scalability and versatility of our solution makes it an ideal choice for power utility companies aiming to segment their users for creating more targeted Demand Response programs.|

Spatial awareness stands as one of the crucial abilities of MLLM, encompassing diverse skills related to understanding spatial relationships among objects and between objects and the scene area. Industries such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, robotics, virtual, and augmented reality heavily demand MLLM's spatial awareness capabilities. However, there exists a noticeable gap between the current spatial awareness capabilities of MLLM and the requirements set by human needs. To address this issue, this paper proposes using more precise spatial position information between objects to guide MLLM in providing more accurate responses to user-related inquiries. Specifically, for a particular multi-modal task, we utilize algorithms for acquiring geometric spatial information and scene graphs to obtain relevant geometric spatial information and scene details of objects involved in the query. Subsequently, based on this information, we direct MLLM to address spatial awareness-related queries posed by the user. Extensive experiments were conducted in benchmarks such as MME, MM-Vet, and other multi-modal large language models. The experimental results thoroughly confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing the spatial awareness tasks and associated tasks of MLLM.|

This paper presents an energy-aware adaptive sampling rate algorithm designed for embedded deployment in resource-constrained, battery-powered IoT devices. The algorithm, based on a finite state machine (FSM) and inspired by Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Reno's additive increase and multiplicative decrease, maximizes sensor sampling rates, ensuring power self-sustainability without risking battery depletion. Moreover, we characterized our solar cell with data acquired over 48 days and used the model created to obtain energy data from an open-source world-wide dataset. To validate our approach, we introduce the EcoTrack device, a versatile device with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) capabilities and Long-Term Evolution Machine Type Communication (LTE-M) connectivity, supporting MQTT protocol for cloud data relay. This multi-purpose device can be used, for instance, as a health and safety wearable, remote hazard monitoring system, or as a global asset tracker. The results, validated on data from three different European cities, show that the proposed algorithm enables self-sustainability while maximizing sampled locations per day. In experiments conducted with a 3000 mAh battery capacity, the algorithm consistently maintained a minimum of 24 localizations per day and achieved peaks of up to 3000.|

Current learning-based motion synthesis methods depend on extensive motion datasets, which are often challenging, if not impossible, to obtain. On the other hand, pose data is more accessible, since static posed characters are easier to create and can even be extracted from images using recent advancements in computer vision. In this paper, we utilize this alternative data source and introduce a neural motion synthesis approach through retargeting. Our method generates plausible motions for characters that have only pose data by transferring motion from an existing motion capture dataset of another character, which can have drastically different skeletons. Our experiments show that our method effectively combines the motion features of the source character with the pose features of the target character, and performs robustly with small or noisy pose data sets, ranging from a few artist-created poses to noisy poses estimated directly from images. Additionally, a conducted user study indicated that a majority of participants found our retargeted motion to be more enjoyable to watch, more lifelike in appearance, and exhibiting fewer artifacts.

Since solidity smart contracts across various domains manage trillions of dollars in virtual coins, they become a prime target for attacks. One of the primary challenges is keeping abreast of the latest techniques and tools for developing secure smart contracts and examining those already deployed. In this paper, we seek to address these challenges from four aspects: (1) We begin by examining ten automatic tools, specifically focusing on their methodologies and their ability to identify vulnerabilities in solidity smart contracts. (2) We propose a novel criterion for evaluating these tools, based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. (3) To facilitate the evaluation of the selected tools, we construct a benchmark that encompasses two distinct datasets: a collection of 389 labelled smart contracts and a scaled set of 20,000 unique cases from real-world contracts. (4) We provide a comparison of the selected tools, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses and highlighting areas where further improvements are needed. Through this evaluation, we hope to provide developers and researchers with valuable guidance on selecting and using smart contract analysis tools and contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and reliability of smart contracts.|

Such emerging geospatial and spatiotemporal big data, coupled with recent advances in deep learning technologies, foster new opportunities to solve problems that have not been possible before. For instance, remote sensing researchers can potentially train a foundation model using Earth imagery big data for numerous land cover and land use modeling tasks. Coastal modelers can train AI surrogates to speed up numerical simulations. However, the distinctive characteristics of spatiotemporal big data pose new challenges for deep learning technologies. This vision paper introduces various types of spatiotemporal big data, discusses new research opportunities in the realm of deep learning applied to spatiotemporal big data, lists the unique challenges, and identifies several future research needs.|

In either case carefully-designed energy functions are minimized, commonly including loss terms like a photometric loss, a landmark reprojection loss, and others. In this work we propose a new loss function for monocular face capture, inspired by how humans would perceive the quality of a 3D face reconstruction given a particular image. It is widely known that shading provides a strong indicator for 3D shape in the human visual system. As such, our new 'perceptual' shape loss aims to judge the quality of a 3D face estimate using only shading cues. Our loss is implemented as a discriminator-style neural network that takes an input face image and a shaded render of the geometry estimate, and then predicts a score that perceptually evaluates how well the shaded render matches the given image. This 'critic' network operates on the RGB image and geometry render alone, without requiring an estimate of the albedo or illumination in the scene. Furthermore, our loss operates entirely in image space and is thus agnostic to mesh topology. We show how our new perceptual shape loss can be combined with traditional energy terms for monocular 3D face optimization and deep neural network regression, improving upon current state-of-the-art results.|

Existing methods fail to cope with frequent occlusions in large-scale scenes with multiple people, and are difficult to effectively utilize spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework,GroupTransformer, for group detection in large-scale scenes. To deal with the frequent occlusions caused by multiple people, we design an occlusion encoder to detect and suppress severely occluded person crops. To explore the potential spatio-temporal relationship, we propose spatio-temporal transformers to simultaneously extract trajectory information and fuse inter-person features in a hierarchical manner. Experimental results on both large-scale and small-scale scenes demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. On large-scale scenes, our method significantly boosts the performance in terms of precision and F1 score by more than 10%. On small-scale scenes, our method still improves the performance of F1 score by more than 5%. The project page with code can be found at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/GroupTrans.|

Tan et.al.|[2310.19201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19201v1)|null|Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are a new, rapidly-growing class of organizations governed by smart contracts. Here we describe how researchers can contribute to the emerging science of DAOs and other digitally-constituted organizations. From granular privacy primitives to mechanism designs to model laws, we identify high-impact problems in the DAO ecosystem where existing gaps might be tackled through a new data set or by applying tools and ideas from existing research fields such as political science, computer science, economics, law, and organizational science. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the wider research community to join the global effort to invent the next generation of organizations.|

Although social issue videos (SIVs) affect public opinions and breed misinformation, how VSP users obtain information and interact with SIVs is under-explored. This work surveyed 659 YouTube and 127 TikTok users to understand the motives for consuming SIVs on VSPs. We found that VSP users are primarily motivated by the information and entertainment gratifications to use the platform. VSP users use SIVs for information-seeking purposes and find YouTube and TikTok convenient to interact with SIVs. VSP users moderately watch SIVs for entertainment and inactively engage in social interactions. SIV consumption is associated with information and socialization gratifications of the platform. VSP users appreciate the diversity of information and opinions but would also do their own research and are concerned about the misinformation and echo chamber problems.|

The corpus is annotated using two different sense inventories simultaneously (Modern and Ghani). SALMA novelty lies in how tokens and senses are associated. Instead of linking a token to only one intended sense, SALMA links a token to multiple senses and provides a score to each sense. A smart web-based annotation tool was developed to support scoring multiple senses against a given word. In addition to sense annotations, we also annotated the corpus using six types of named entities. The quality of our annotations was assessed using various metrics (Kappa, Linear Weighted Kappa, Quadratic Weighted Kappa, Mean Average Error, and Root Mean Square Error), which show very high inter-annotator agreement. To establish a Word Sense Disambiguation baseline using our SALMA corpus, we developed an end-to-end Word Sense Disambiguation system using Target Sense Verification. We used this system to evaluate three Target Sense Verification models available in the literature. Our best model achieved an accuracy with 84.2% using Modern and 78.7% using Ghani. The full corpus and the annotation tool are open-source and publicly available at https://sina.birzeit.edu/salma/.|

A secured identity management system ensures both security and the efficient provision of services for the host nation and the donor organizations. Realizing the benefits, a handful of studies enriched the blockchain-based security identification for refugees. The research studies presented the introductory, conceptual, and practical solution related to the blockchain-based smart contract. There is a common agreement in the studies that blockchain-based smart contract not only streamlines refugee identity verification but also safeguards against unauthorized entries. Since it is a technology as well, it has been essential to know the present status of the technology in the social context. In such a situation it becomes essential to review the existing research studies to provide insight for future studies. In this study, we reviewed current studies using a thematic approach. Our findings suggest researchers are more inclined to provide conceptual models as the models are important in advancing technology; however, the models need to be implemented for practical advances. However, the main contribution of this study is that this study gathers current efforts in smart contract-based refugee identity management. This study is important for the refugee host nations as well as for stakeholders. Knowledge gained from the study is expected to provide insight into how the technology can be developed using existing theory and implementation frameworks.|
