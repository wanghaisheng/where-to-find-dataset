# title:**Safety monitoring under stealthy sensor injection attacks using reachable sets**  ## publish date: **2023-07-24** ## authors:   CÃ©dric Escudero et.al. ## abstract:   Stealthy sensor injection attacks are serious threats for industrial plants as they can compromise the plant's integrity without being detected by traditional fault detectors. In this manuscript, we study the possibility of revealing the presence of such attacks by monitoring only the control input. This approach consists in computing an ellipsoidal bound of the input reachable set. When the control input does not belong to this set, this means that a stealthy sensor injection attack is driving the plant to critical states. The problem of finding this ellipsoidal bound is posed as a convex optimization problem (convex cost with Linear Matrix Inequalities constraints). Our monitoring approach is tested in simulation.
