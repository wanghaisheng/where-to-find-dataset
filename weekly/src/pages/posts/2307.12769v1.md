# title:**First look at data from the 13-antenna setup of GRANDProto300 in northwest China**  ## publish date: **2023-07-24** ## authors:   Peng-Xiong Ma et.al. ## abstract:   The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays, with energies above 100 PeV. GRAND targets the radio signals emitted by extensive air showers induced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles in the atmosphere, using an array of 200,000 radio antennas split into sub-arrays deployed worldwide. GRANDProto13 (GP13) is a 13-antenna demonstrator array deployed in February 2023 in the Gansu province of China, as a precursor for GRANDProto300, which will validate the detection principle of the GRAND experiment. Its goal is to measure the radio background present at the site, validate the design of the detection units and develop an autonomous radio trigger for air showers. We will describe GP13 and its operation, and show preliminary results on noise monitoring.
