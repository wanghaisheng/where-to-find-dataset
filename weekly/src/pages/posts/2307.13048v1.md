# title:**The IceCube-Gen2 Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2023)**  ## publish date: **2023-07-24** ## authors:   IceCube-Gen2 et.al. ## abstract:   IceCube-Gen2 is a planned next-generation neutrino observatory at the South Pole that builds upon the successful design of IceCube. Integrating two complementary detection technologies for neutrinos, optical and radio Cherenkov emission, in combination with a surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceCube-Gen2 will cover a broad neutrino energy range from MeV to EeV. This index of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Nagoya, Japan (July 26 - August 3, 2023) describes research and development efforts for IceCube-Gen2. Included are summaries of the design, status, and sensitivity of the IceCube-Gen2 optical, surface, and radio components; performance studies of next-generation optical sensors detecting optical Cherenkov radiation from cosmic ray and neutrino events; reconstruction techniques of radio and optical events in terms of energy, direction, and neutrino flavor; and sensitivity studies of astrophysical neutrino flavors, diffuse neutrino fluxes, and cosmic ray anisotropies. Contributions related to IceCube and the scheduled IceCube Upgrade are available in a separate collection.
